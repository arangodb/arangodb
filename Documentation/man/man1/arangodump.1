.SH NAME
arangodump - a tool to create logical dumps of an ArangoDB database
.SH SYNOPSIS
arangodump [options] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
The arangodump binary can be used to create logical dumps of collection
meta information and collection data (documents) of an ArangoDB database.
By default, all non-system collections of the specified ArangoDB database
will be dumped with structural information and data. 

For each collection, a file named "<collection>.structure.json" will be
created with information about the collection. When data is also dumped,
an additional file "<collection>.data.json" will also be created.
All dump files will be placed in a directory, which will be created by
arangodump when run. If the directory already exists, arangodump will refuse to
work unless started with the option "--overwrite true".

arangodump will work on the specified database only. If no database name
is specified, arangodump will work on the default database ("_system").

The dumped files can be re-stored in an ArangoDB database using the
arangorestore tool.
.SH OPTIONS
The arangodump binary has many options that can be used to control its
behavior.  For a complete list of options, please refer to the
ArangoDB online manual, available at https://www.arangodb.com/
