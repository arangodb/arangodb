@startDocuBlock collectionProperties
@brief gets or sets the properties of a collection
`collection.properties()`

Returns an object containing all collection properties.

* *waitForSync*: If *true* creating a document will only return
  after the data was synced to disk.

* *journalSize* : The size of the journal in bytes.
  This option is meaningful for the MMFiles storage engine only.

* *isVolatile*: If *true* then the collection data will be
  kept in memory only and ArangoDB will not write or sync the data
  to disk.
  This option is meaningful for the MMFiles storage engine only.

* *keyOptions* (optional) additional options for key generation. This is
  a JSON array containing the following attributes (note: some of the
  attributes are optional):
  * *type*: the type of the key generator used for the collection.
  * *allowUserKeys*: if set to *true*, then it is allowed to supply
    own key values in the *_key* attribute of a document. If set to
    *false*, then the key generator will solely be responsible for
    generating keys and supplying own key values in the *_key* attribute
    of documents is considered an error.
  * *increment*: increment value for *autoincrement* key generator.
    Not used for other key generator types.
  * *offset*: initial offset value for *autoincrement* key generator.
    Not used for other key generator types.

* *schema* (optional, default is *null*): 
  Object that specifies the collection level document schema for documents.
  The attribute keys `rule`, `level` and `message` must follow the rules
  documented in [Document Schema Validation](https://www.arangodb.com/docs/devel/document-schema-validation.html)

In a cluster setup, the result will also contain the following attributes:

* *numberOfShards*: the number of shards of the collection.

* *shardKeys*: contains the names of document attributes that are used to
  determine the target shard for documents.

* *replicationFactor*: determines how many copies of each shard are kept
  on different DB-Servers. Has to be in the range of 1-10 or the string
  `"satellite"` for a SatelliteCollection (Enterprise Edition only).
  _(cluster only)_

* *writeConcern*: determines how many copies of each shard are required to be
  in sync on the different DB-Servers. If there are less then these many copies
  in the cluster a shard will refuse to write. Writes to shards with enough
  up-to-date copies will succeed at the same time however. The value of
  *writeConcern* can not be larger than *replicationFactor*. _(cluster only)_

* *shardingStrategy*: the sharding strategy selected for the collection.
  This attribute will only be populated in cluster mode and is not populated
  in single-server mode. _(cluster only)_

`collection.properties(properties)`

Changes the collection properties. *properties* must be an object with
one or more of the following attribute(s):

* *waitForSync*: If *true* creating a document will only return
  after the data was synced to disk.

* *journalSize*: The size of the journal in bytes.
  This option is meaningful for the MMFiles storage engine only.

* *replicationFactor*: Change the number of shard copies kept on
  different DB-Servers. Valid values are integer numbers in the range of 1-10
  or the string `"satellite"` for a SatelliteCollection (Enterprise Edition only).
  _(cluster only)_

* *writeConcern*: change how many copies of each shard are required to be
  in sync on the different DB-Servers. If there are less then these many copies
  in the cluster a shard will refuse to write. Writes to shards with enough
  up-to-date copies will succeed at the same time however. The value of
  *writeConcern* can not be larger than *replicationFactor*. _(cluster only)_

**Note**: some other collection properties, such as *type*, *isVolatile*,
*keyOptions*, *numberOfShards* or *shardingStrategy* cannot be changed once 
the collection is created.
