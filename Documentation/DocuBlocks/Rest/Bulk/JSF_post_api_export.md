@brief export all documents from a collection, using a cursor

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/export, Create export cursor}

@RESTBODYPARAM{flush,boolean,required,}
if set to *true*, a WAL flush operation will be executed prior to the
export. The flush operation will start copying documents from the WAL to the
collection's datafiles. There will be an additional wait time of up
to *flushWait* seconds after the flush to allow the WAL collector to change
the adjusted document meta-data to point into the datafiles, too.
The default value is *false* (i.e. no flush) so most recently inserted or
updated
documents from the collection might be missing in the export.

@RESTBODYPARAM{flushWait,integer,required,int64}
maximum wait time in seconds after a flush operation. The default
value is 10. This option only has an effect when *flush* is set to *true*.

@RESTBODYPARAM{count,boolean,required,}
boolean flag that indicates whether the number of documents
in the result set should be returned in the "count" attribute of the result
(optional).
Calculating the "count" attribute might in the future have a performance
impact so this option is turned off by default, and "count" is only returned
when requested.

@RESTBODYPARAM{batchSize,integer,required,int64}
maximum number of result documents to be transferred from
the server to the client in one roundtrip (optional). If this attribute is
not set, a server-controlled default value will be used.

@RESTBODYPARAM{limit,integer,required,int64}
an optional limit value, determining the maximum number of documents to
be included in the cursor. Omitting the *limit* attribute or setting it to 0 will
lead to no limit being used. If a limit is used, it is undefined which documents
from the collection will be included in the export and which will be excluded. 
This is because there is no natural order of documents in a collection.

@RESTBODYPARAM{ttl,integer,required,int64}
an optional time-to-live for the cursor (in seconds). The cursor will be
removed on the server automatically after the specified amount of time. This
is useful to ensure garbage collection of cursors that are not fully fetched
by clients. If not set, a server-defined value will be used.

@RESTBODYPARAM{restrict,object,optional,JSF_post_api_export_restrictions}
an object containing an array of attribute names that will be 
included or excluded when returning result documents.

Not specifying *restrict* will by default return all attributes of each document.

@RESTSTRUCT{type,JSF_post_api_export_restrictions,string,required,string}
has to be be set to either *include* or *exclude* depending on which you want to use

@RESTSTRUCT{fields,JSF_post_api_export_restrictions,array,required,string}
Contains an array of attribute names to *include* or *exclude*. Matching of attribute names
for *inclusion* or *exclusion* will be done on the top level only.
Specifying names of nested attributes is not supported at the moment.


@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{collection,string,required}
The name of the collection to export.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
A call to this method creates a cursor containing all documents in the 
specified collection. In contrast to other data-producing APIs, the internal
data structures produced by the export API are more lightweight, so it is
the preferred way to retrieve all documents from a collection.

Documents are returned in a similar manner as in the `/_api/cursor` RESTful API. 
If all documents of the collection fit into the first batch, then no cursor
will be created, and the result object's *hasMore* attribute will be set to
*false*. If not all documents fit into the first batch, then the result 
object's *hasMore* attribute will be set to *true*, and the *id* attribute
of the result will contain a cursor id.

The order in which the documents are returned is not specified.

By default, only those documents from the collection will be returned that are
stored in the collection's datafiles. Documents that are present in the write-ahead
log (WAL) at the time the export is run will not be exported.

To export these documents as well, the caller can issue a WAL flush request
before calling the export API or set the *flush* attribute. Setting the *flush*
option will trigger a WAL flush before the export so documents get copied from 
the WAL to the collection datafiles.

If the result set can be created by the server, the server will respond with
*HTTP 201*. The body of the response will contain a JSON object with the
result set.

The returned JSON object has the following properties:

- *error*: boolean flag to indicate that an error occurred (*false*
  in this case)

- *code*: the HTTP status code

- *result*: an array of result documents (might be empty if the collection was empty)

- *hasMore*: a boolean indicator whether there are more results
  available for the cursor on the server

- *count*: the total number of result documents available (only
  available if the query was executed with the *count* attribute set)

- *id*: id of temporary cursor created on the server (optional, see above)

If the JSON representation is malformed or the query specification is
missing from the request, the server will respond with *HTTP 400*.

The body of the response will contain a JSON object with additional error
details. The object has the following attributes:

- *error*: boolean flag to indicate that an error occurred (*true* in this case)

- *code*: the HTTP status code

- *errorNum*: the server error number

- *errorMessage*: a descriptive error message

Clients should always delete an export cursor result as early as possible because a
lingering export cursor will prevent the underlying collection from being
compacted or unloaded. By default, unused cursors will be deleted automatically 
after a server-defined idle time, and clients can adjust this idle time by setting
the *ttl* value.

Note: this API is currently not supported on cluster coordinators.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
is returned if the result set can be created by the server.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if the JSON representation is malformed or the query specification is
missing from the request.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
The server will respond with *HTTP 404* in case a non-existing collection is
accessed in the query.

@RESTRETURNCODE{405}
The server will respond with *HTTP 405* if an unsupported HTTP method is used.

@RESTRETURNCODE{501}
The server will respond with *HTTP 501* if this API is called on a cluster
coordinator.
