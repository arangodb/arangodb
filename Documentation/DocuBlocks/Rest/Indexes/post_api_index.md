@brief creates an index

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/index, Create index, createIndex}

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{collection,string,required}
The collection name.

@RESTALLBODYPARAM{index-details,object,required}
The options for the index.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Creates a new index in the collection `collection`. Expects
an object containing the index details.

The type of the index to be created must specified in the **type**
attribute of the index details. Depending on the index type, additional
other attributes may need to specified in the request in order to create
the index.

Indexes require the to be indexed attribute(s) in the **fields** attribute
of the index details. Depending on the index type, a single attribute or
multiple attributes can be indexed. In the latter case, an array of
strings is expected.

The `.` character denotes sub-attributes in attribute paths. Attributes with
literal `.` in their name cannot be indexed. Attributes with the name `_id`
cannot be indexed either, neither as a top-level attribute nor as a sub-attribute.

Optionally, an index name may be specified as a string in the **name** attribute.
Index names have the same restrictions as collection names. If no value is
specified, one will be auto-generated.

Persistent indexes (including vertex-centric indexes) can be created as unique
or non-unique variants. Uniqueness can be controlled by specifying the
**unique** option for the index definition. Setting it to `true` creates a
unique index. Setting it to `false` or omitting the `unique` attribute creates a
non-unique index.

**Note**: Unique indexes on non-shard keys are not supported in a cluster.

Persistent indexes can optionally be created in a sparse
variant. A sparse index will be created if the **sparse** attribute in
the index details is set to `true`. Sparse indexes do not index documents
for which any of the index attributes is either not set or is `null`.

The optional **deduplicate** attribute is supported by persistent array indexes.
It controls whether inserting duplicate index values
from the same document into a unique array index will lead to a unique constraint
error or not. The default value is `true`, so only a single instance of each
non-unique index value will be inserted into the index per document. Trying to
insert a value into the index that already exists in the index always fails,
regardless of the value of this attribute.

The optional **estimates** attribute is supported by persistent indexes.
This attribute controls whether index selectivity estimates are
maintained for the index. Not maintaining index selectivity estimates can have
a slightly positive impact on write performance.
The downside of turning off index selectivity estimates will be that
the query optimizer will not be able to determine the usefulness of different
competing indexes in AQL queries when there are multiple candidate indexes to
choose from.
The `estimates` attribute is optional and defaults to `true` if not set. It will
have no effect on indexes other than persistent indexes.

The optional attribute **cacheEnabled** is supported by indexes of type
*persistent*. This attribute controls whether an extra in-memory hash cache is
created for the index. The hash cache can be used to speed up index lookups.
The cache can only be used for queries that look up all index attributes via
an equality lookup (`==`). The hash cache cannot be used for range scans,
partial lookups or sorting.
The cache will be populated lazily upon reading data from the index. Writing data
into the collection or updating existing data will invalidate entries in the
cache. The cache may have a negative effect on performance in case index values
are updated more often than they are read.
The maximum size of cache entries that can be stored is currently 4 MB, i.e.
the cumulated size of all index entries for any index lookup value must be
less than 4 MB. This limitation is there to avoid storing the index entries
of "super nodes" in the cache.
`cacheEnabled` defaults to `false` and should only be used for indexes that
are known to benefit from an extra layer of caching.

The optional attribute **inBackground** can be set to `true` to create the index
in the background, which will not write-lock the underlying collection for
as long as if the index is built in the foreground.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
If the index already exists, then an *HTTP 200* is returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
If the index does not already exist and could be created, then an *HTTP 201*
is returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
If an invalid index description is posted or attributes are used that the
target index will not support, then an *HTTP 400* is returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
If *collection* is unknown, then an *HTTP 404* is returned.
