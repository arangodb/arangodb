@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{collection,string,required}
The collection name.

@RESTBODYPARAM{type,string,required,string}
Must be equal to `"persistent"`.

@RESTBODYPARAM{name,string,optional,string}
An easy-to-remember name for the index to look it up or refer to it in index hints.
Index names are subject to the same character restrictions as collection names.
If omitted, a name is auto-generated so that it is unique with respect to the
collection, e.g. `idx_832910498`.

@RESTBODYPARAM{fields,array,required,string}
An array of attribute paths.

The `.` character denotes sub-attributes in attribute paths. Attributes with
literal `.` in their name cannot be indexed. Attributes with the name `_id`
cannot be indexed either, neither as a top-level attribute nor as a sub-attribute.

You can expand one array attribute with `[*]`.

@RESTBODYPARAM{storedValues,array,optional,string}
The optional `storedValues` attribute can contain an array of paths to additional 
attributes to store in the index. These additional attributes cannot be used for
index lookups or for sorting, but they can be used for projections. This allows an
index to fully cover more queries and avoid extra document lookups.
The maximum number of attributes in `storedValues` is 32.

It is not possible to create multiple indexes with the same `fields` attributes
and uniqueness but different `storedValues` attributes. That means the value of
`storedValues` is not considered by index creation calls when checking if an
index is already present or needs to be created.

In unique indexes, only the attributes in `fields` are checked for uniqueness,
but the attributes in `storedValues` are not checked for their uniqueness. 
Non-existing attributes are stored as `null` values inside `storedValues`.

@RESTBODYPARAM{unique,boolean,optional,}
If `true`, then create a unique index. Defaults to `false`.
In unique indexes, only the attributes in `fields` are checked for uniqueness,
but the attributes in `storedValues` are not checked for their uniqueness.

@RESTBODYPARAM{sparse,boolean,optional,}
If `true`, then create a sparse index. Defaults to `false`.

@RESTBODYPARAM{deduplicate,boolean,optional,}
The attribute controls whether inserting duplicate index values
from the same document into a unique array index will lead to a unique constraint
error or not. The default value is `true`, so only a single instance of each
non-unique index value will be inserted into the index per document. Trying to
insert a value into the index that already exists in the index will always fail,
regardless of the value of this attribute.

@RESTBODYPARAM{estimates,boolean,optional,}
This attribute controls whether index selectivity estimates are maintained for the
index. Not maintaining index selectivity estimates can have a slightly positive
impact on write performance.

The downside of turning off index selectivity estimates will be that
the query optimizer will not be able to determine the usefulness of different
competing indexes in AQL queries when there are multiple candidate indexes to
choose from.

The `estimates` attribute is optional and defaults to `true` if not set. It will
have no effect on indexes other than `persistent`.

@RESTBODYPARAM{cacheEnabled,boolean,optional,}
This attribute controls whether an extra in-memory hash cache is
created for the index. The hash cache can be used to speed up index lookups.
The cache can only be used for queries that look up all index attributes via
an equality lookup (`==`). The hash cache cannot be used for range scans,
partial lookups or sorting.

The cache will be populated lazily upon reading data from the index. Writing data
into the collection or updating existing data will invalidate entries in the
cache. The cache may have a negative effect on performance in case index values
are updated more often than they are read.

The maximum size of cache entries that can be stored is currently 4 MB, i.e.
the cumulated size of all index entries for any index lookup value must be
less than 4 MB. This limitation is there to avoid storing the index entries
of "super nodes" in the cache.

`cacheEnabled` defaults to `false` and should only be used for indexes that
are known to benefit from an extra layer of caching.

@RESTBODYPARAM{inBackground,boolean,optional,}
This attribute can be set to `true` to create the index
in the background, which will not write-lock the underlying collection for
as long as if the index is built in the foreground. The default value is `false`.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Creates a persistent index for the collection `collection-name`, if
it does not already exist. The call expects an object containing the index
details.

In a sparse index all documents will be excluded from the index that do not
contain at least one of the specified index attributes (i.e. `fields`) or that
have a value of `null` in any of the specified index attributes. Such documents
will not be indexed, and not be taken into account for uniqueness checks if
the `unique` flag is set.

In a non-sparse index, these documents will be indexed (for non-present
indexed attributes, a value of `null` will be used) and will be taken into
account for uniqueness checks if the `unique` flag is set.

**Note**: Unique indexes on non-shard keys are not supported in a cluster.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
If the index already exists, then a *HTTP 200* is
returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
If the index does not already exist and could be created, then a *HTTP 201*
is returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
If the collection already contains documents and you try to create a unique
persistent index in such a way that there are documents violating the
uniqueness, then a *HTTP 400* is returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
If the `collection-name` is unknown, then a *HTTP 404* is returned.

Creating a persistent index

    var body = {
      type: "persistent",
      unique: false,
      fields: [ "a", "b" ]
    };

    var response = logCurlRequest('POST', url, body);

    assert(response.code === 201);
