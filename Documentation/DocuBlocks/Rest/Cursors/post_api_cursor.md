@brief create a cursor and return the first results

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/cursor, Create cursor}

A JSON object describing the query and query parameters.

@RESTBODYPARAM{query,string,required,string}
contains the query string to be executed

@RESTBODYPARAM{count,boolean,optional,}
indicates whether the number of documents in the result set should be returned in
the "count" attribute of the result.
Calculating the "count" attribute might have a performance impact for some queries
in the future so this option is turned off by default, and "count"
is only returned when requested.

@RESTBODYPARAM{batchSize,integer,optional,int64}
maximum number of result documents to be transferred from
the server to the client in one roundtrip. If this attribute is
not set, a server-controlled default value will be used. A *batchSize* value of
*0* is disallowed.

@RESTBODYPARAM{ttl,integer,optional,int64}
The time-to-live for the cursor (in seconds). The cursor will be
removed on the server automatically after the specified amount of time. This
is useful to ensure garbage collection of cursors that are not fully fetched
by clients. If not set, a server-defined value will be used.

@RESTBODYPARAM{cache,boolean,optional,}
flag to determine whether the AQL query results cache
shall be used. If set to *false*, then any query cache lookup will be skipped
for the query. If set to *true*, it will lead to the query cache being checked
for the query if the query cache mode is either *on* or *demand*.

@RESTBODYPARAM{memoryLimit,integer,optional,int64}
the maximum number of memory (measured in bytes) that the query is allowed to
use. If set, then the query will fail with error "resource limit exceeded" in
case it allocates too much memory. A value of *0* indicates that there is no
memory limit.

@RESTBODYPARAM{bindVars,array,optional,object}
key/value pairs representing the bind parameters.

@RESTBODYPARAM{options,object,optional,post_api_cursor_opts}
key/value object with extra options for the query.

@RESTSTRUCT{fullCount,post_api_cursor_opts,boolean,optional,}
if set to *true* and the query contains a *LIMIT* clause, then the
result will have an *extra* attribute with the sub-attributes *stats*
and *fullCount*, `{ ... , "extra": { "stats": { "fullCount": 123 } } }`.
The *fullCount* attribute will contain the number of documents in the result before the
last top-level LIMIT in the query was applied. It can be used to count the number of 
documents that match certain filter criteria, but only return a subset of them, in one go.
It is thus similar to MySQL's *SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS* hint. Note that setting the option
will disable a few LIMIT optimizations and may lead to more documents being processed,
and thus make queries run longer. Note that the *fullCount* attribute may only
be present in the result if the query has a top-level LIMIT clause and the LIMIT 
clause is actually used in the query.

@RESTSTRUCT{maxPlans,post_api_cursor_opts,integer,optional,int64}
Limits the maximum number of plans that are created by the AQL query optimizer.

@RESTSTRUCT{maxWarningCount,post_api_cursor_opts,integer,optional,int64}
Limits the maximum number of warnings a query will return. The number of warnings
a query will return is limited to 10 by default, but that number can be increased
or decreased by setting this attribute.

@RESTSTRUCT{failOnWarning,post_api_cursor_opts,boolean,optional,}
When set to *true*, the query will throw an exception and abort instead of producing
a warning. This option should be used during development to catch potential issues
early. When the attribute is set to *false*, warnings will not be propagated to
exceptions and will be returned with the query result.
There is also a server configuration option `--query.fail-on-warning` for setting the
default value for *failOnWarning* so it does not need to be set on a per-query level.

@RESTSTRUCT{stream,post_api_cursor_opts,boolean,optional,}
Specify *true* and the query will be executed in a **streaming** fashion. The query result is
not stored on the server, but calculated on the fly. *Beware*: long-running queries will
need to hold the collection locks for as long as the query cursor exists. 
When set to *false* a query will be executed right away in its entirety. 
In that case query results are either returned right away (if the result set is small enough),
or stored on the arangod instance and accessible via the cursor API (with respect to the `ttl`). 
It is advisable to *only* use this option on short-running queries or without exclusive locks 
(write-locks on MMFiles).
Please note that the query options `cache`, `count` and `fullCount` will not work on streaming queries.
Additionally query statistics, warnings and profiling data will only be available after the query is finished.
The default value is *false*

@RESTSTRUCT{optimizer.rules,post_api_cursor_opts,array,optional,string}
A list of to-be-included or to-be-excluded optimizer rules
can be put into this attribute, telling the optimizer to include or exclude
specific rules. To disable a rule, prefix its name with a `-`, to enable a rule, prefix it
with a `+`. There is also a pseudo-rule `all`, which will match all optimizer rules.

@RESTSTRUCT{profile,post_api_cursor_opts,integer,optional,}
If set to *true* or *1*, then the additional query profiling information will be returned
in the sub-attribute *profile* of the *extra* return attribute, if the query result
is not served from the query cache. Set to *2* the query will include execution stats
per query plan node in sub-attribute *stats.nodes* of the *extra* return attribute.
Additionally the query plan is returned in the sub-attribute *extra.plan*.

@RESTSTRUCT{satelliteSyncWait,post_api_cursor_opts,boolean,optional,}
This *Enterprise Edition* parameter allows to configure how long a DBServer will have time
to bring the satellite collections involved in the query into sync.
The default value is *60.0* (seconds). When the max time has been reached the query
will be stopped.

@RESTSTRUCT{maxTransactionSize,post_api_cursor_opts,integer,optional,int64}
Transaction size limit in bytes. Honored by the RocksDB storage engine only.

@RESTSTRUCT{intermediateCommitSize,post_api_cursor_opts,integer,optional,int64}
Maximum total size of operations after which an intermediate commit is performed
automatically. Honored by the RocksDB storage engine only.

@RESTSTRUCT{intermediateCommitCount,post_api_cursor_opts,integer,optional,int64}
Maximum number of operations after which an intermediate commit is performed
automatically. Honored by the RocksDB storage engine only.

@RESTSTRUCT{skipInaccessibleCollections,post_api_cursor_opts,boolean,optional,}
AQL queries (especially graph traversals) will treat collection to which a user has no access rights as if these collections were empty. Instead of returning a forbidden access error, your queries will execute normally. This is intended to help with certain use-cases: A graph contains several collections and different users execute AQL queries on that graph. You can now naturally limit the accessible results by changing the access rights of users on collections. This feature is only available in the Enterprise Edition.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
The query details include the query string plus optional query options and
bind parameters. These values need to be passed in a JSON representation in
the body of the POST request.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
is returned if the result set can be created by the server.

@RESTREPLYBODY{error,boolean,required,}
A flag to indicate that an error occurred (*false* in this case)

@RESTREPLYBODY{code,integer,required,integer}
the HTTP status code

@RESTREPLYBODY{result,array,optional,}
an array of result documents (might be empty if query has no results)

@RESTREPLYBODY{hasMore,boolean,required,}
A boolean indicator whether there are more results
available for the cursor on the server

@RESTREPLYBODY{count,integer,optional,int64}
the total number of result documents available (only
available if the query was executed with the *count* attribute set)

@RESTREPLYBODY{id,string,required,string}
id of temporary cursor created on the server (optional, see above)

@RESTREPLYBODY{extra,object,optional,}
an optional JSON object with extra information about the query result
contained in its *stats* sub-attribute. For data-modification queries, the
*extra.stats* sub-attribute will contain the number of modified documents and
the number of documents that could not be modified
due to an error (if *ignoreErrors* query option is specified)

@RESTREPLYBODY{cached,boolean,required,}
a boolean flag indicating whether the query result was served
from the query cache or not. If the query result is served from the query
cache, the *extra* return attribute will not contain any *stats* sub-attribute
and no *profile* sub-attribute.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if the JSON representation is malformed or the query specification is
missing from the request.

If the JSON representation is malformed or the query specification is
missing from the request, the server will respond with *HTTP 400*.

The body of the response will contain a JSON object with additional error
details. The object has the following attributes:

@RESTREPLYBODY{error,boolean,required,}
boolean flag to indicate that an error occurred (*true* in this case)

@RESTREPLYBODY{code,integer,required,int64}
the HTTP status code

@RESTREPLYBODY{errorNum,integer,required,int64}
the server error number

@RESTREPLYBODY{errorMessage,string,required,string}
a descriptive error message

If the query specification is complete, the server will process the query. If an
error occurs during query processing, the server will respond with *HTTP 400*.
Again, the body of the response will contain details about the error.

A [list of query errors can be found here](../../Manual/Appendix/ErrorCodes.html).


@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
The server will respond with *HTTP 404* in case a non-existing collection is
accessed in the query.

@RESTRETURNCODE{405}
The server will respond with *HTTP 405* if an unsupported HTTP method is used.
