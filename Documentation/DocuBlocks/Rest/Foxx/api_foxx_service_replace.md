@brief replace a service

@RESTHEADER{PUT /_api/foxx/service, Replace service}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Removes the service at the given mount path from the database and file system.
Then installs the given new service at the same mount path.

This is a slightly safer equivalent to performing an uninstall of the old service
followed by installing the new service. The new service's main and script files
(if any) will be checked for basic syntax errors before the old service is removed.

The request body can be any of the following formats:

- `application/zip`: a raw zip bundle containing a service
- `application/javascript`: a standalone JavaScript file
- `application/json`: a service definition as JSON
- `multipart/form-data`: a service definition as a multipart form

A service definition is an object or form with the following properties or fields:

- *configuration*: a JSON object describing configuration values
- *dependencies*: a JSON object describing dependency settings
- *source*: a fully qualified URL or an absolute path on the server's file system

When using multipart data, the *source* field can also alternatively be a file field
containing either a zip bundle or a standalone JavaScript file.

When using a standalone JavaScript file the given file will be executed
to define our service's HTTP endpoints. It is the same which would be defined
in the field `main` of the service manifest.

If *source* is a URL, the URL must be reachable from the server.
If *source* is a file system path, the path will be resolved on the server.
In either case the path or URL is expected to resolve to a zip bundle,
JavaScript file or (in case of a file system path) directory.

Note that when using file system paths in a cluster with multiple coordinators
the file system path must resolve to equivalent files on every coordinator.
