@brief Enable or disable the maintenance mode of a DB-Server

@RESTHEADER{PUT /_admin/cluster/maintenance/{DB-Server-ID}, Enable or disable the DB-Server maintenance mode, setDbserverMaintenance}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
For rolling upgrades or rolling restarts, DB-Servers can be put into
maintenance mode, so that no attempts are made to re-distribute the data in a
cluster for such planned events. DB-Servers in maintenance mode are not
considered viable failover targets because they are likely restarted soon.

@RESTBODYPARAM{timeout,integer,optional,}
After how many seconds the maintenance mode shall automatically end.
You can send another request when the DB-Server is already in maintenance mode
to extend the timeout.

@RESTRETURNCODES
