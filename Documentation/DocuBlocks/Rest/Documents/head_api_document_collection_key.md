@RESTHEADER{HEAD /_api/document/{collection}/{key},Get a document header,getDocumentHeader}

@RESTURLPARAMETERS

@RESTURLPARAM{collection,string,required}
Name of the `collection` from which the document is to be read.

@RESTURLPARAM{key,string,required}
The document key.

@RESTHEADERPARAMETERS

@RESTHEADERPARAM{If-None-Match,string,optional}
If the "If-None-Match" header is given, then it must contain exactly one
ETag. If the current document revision is not equal to the specified ETag,
an *HTTP 200* response is returned. If the current document revision is
identical to the specified ETag, then an *HTTP 304* is returned.

@RESTHEADERPARAM{If-Match,string,optional}
If the "If-Match" header is given, then it must contain exactly one
ETag. The document is returned, if it has the same revision as the
given ETag. Otherwise a *HTTP 412* is returned.

@RESTHEADERPARAM{x-arango-allow-dirty-read,boolean,optional}
Set this header to `true` to allow the Coordinator to ask any shard replica for
the data, not only the shard leader. This may result in "dirty reads".

The header is ignored if this operation is part of a Stream Transaction
(`x-arango-trx-id` header). The header set when creating the transaction decides
about dirty reads for the entire transaction, not the individual read operations.

@RESTHEADERPARAM{x-arango-trx-id,string,optional}
To make this operation a part of a Stream Transaction, set this header to the
transaction ID returned by the `POST /_api/transaction/begin` call.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Like `GET`, but only returns the header fields and not the body. You
can use this call to get the current revision of a document or check if
the document was deleted.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
is returned if the document was found

@RESTRETURNCODE{304}
is returned if the "If-None-Match" header is given and the document has
the same version

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
is returned if the document or collection was not found

@RESTRETURNCODE{412}
is returned if an "If-Match" header is given and the found
document has a different version. The response will also contain the found
document's current revision in the `ETag` header.

@EXAMPLES

@EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_RUN{RestDocumentHandlerReadDocumentHead}
    var cn = "products";
    db._drop(cn);
    db._create(cn);

    var document = db.products.save({"hello":"world"});
    var url = "/_api/document/" + document._id;

    var response = logCurlRequest('HEAD', url);

    assert(response.code === 200);
  ~ db._drop(cn);
