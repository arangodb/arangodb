@RESTURLPARAMETERS

@RESTURLPARAM{collection-name,string,required}
The name of the collection.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Loads a collection into memory. Returns the collection on success.

The request body object might optionally contain the following attribute:

- *count*: If set, this controls whether the return value should include
  the number of documents in the collection. Setting *count* to
  *false* may speed up loading a collection. The default value for
  *count* is *true*.

On success an object with the following attributes is returned:

- *id*: The identifier of the collection.

- *name*: The name of the collection.

- *count*: The number of documents inside the collection. This is only
  returned if the *count* input parameters is set to *true* or has
  not been specified.

- *status*: The status of the collection as number.

- *type*: The collection type. Valid types are:
  - 2: document collection
  - 3: edges collection

- *isSystem*: If *true* then the collection is a system collection.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
If the *collection-name* is missing, then a *HTTP 400* is
returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
If the *collection-name* is unknown, then a *HTTP 404*
is returned.
