@brief returns a list of slow running AQL queries

@RESTHEADER{GET /_api/query/slow, Returns the list of slow AQL queries}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Returns an array containing the last AQL queries that are finished and
have exceeded the slow query threshold in the selected database.
The maximum amount of queries in the list can be controlled by setting
the query tracking property `maxSlowQueries`. The threshold for treating
a query as *slow* can be adjusted by setting the query tracking property
`slowQueryThreshold`.

Each query is a JSON object with the following attributes:

- *id*: the query's id

- *query*: the query string (potentially truncated)

- *bindVars*: the bind parameter values used by the query

- *started*: the date and time when the query was started

- *runTime*: the query's total run time 

- *state*: the query's current execution state (will always be "finished"
  for the list of slow queries)

- *stream*: whether or not the query uses a streaming cursor

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
Is returned when the list of queries can be retrieved successfully.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
