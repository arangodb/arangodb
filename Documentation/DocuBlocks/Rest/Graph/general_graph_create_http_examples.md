@brief Create a new graph in the graph module.

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/gharial, Create a graph}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
The creation of a graph requires the name of the graph and a
definition of its edges.
[See also edge definitions](../../Manual/Graphs/GeneralGraphs/Management.html#edge-definitions).

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{waitForSync,boolean,optional}
define if the request should wait until everything is synced to disc.
Will change the success response code.

@RESTBODYPARAM{name,string,required,string}
Name of the graph.

@RESTBODYPARAM{edgeDefinitions,array,optional,graph_edge_definition}
An array of definitions for the relations of the graph.
Each has the following type:

@RESTBODYPARAM{isSmart,boolean,optional,boolean}
Define if the created graph should be smart.
This only has effect in Enterprise Edition.

@RESTBODYPARAM{options,object,optional,post_api_gharial_create_opts}
a JSON object to define options for creating collections within this graph.
It can contain the following attributes:

@RESTSTRUCT{smartGraphAttribute,post_api_gharial_create_opts,string,optional,}
Only has effect in Enterprise Edition and it is required if isSmart is true.
The attribute name that is used to smartly shard the vertices of a graph.
Every vertex in this SmartGraph has to have this attribute.
Cannot be modified later.

@RESTSTRUCT{numberOfShards,post_api_gharial_create_opts,integer,required,}
The number of shards that is used for every collection within this graph.
Cannot be modified later.

@RESTSTRUCT{replicationFactor,post_api_gharial_create_opts,integer,required,}
The replication factor used when initially creating collections for this graph.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
Is returned if the graph could be created and waitForSync is enabled
for the `_graphs` collection, or given in the request.
The response body contains the graph configuration that has been stored.

@RESTREPLYBODY{error,boolean,required,}
Flag if there was an error (true) or not (false).
It is false in this response.

@RESTREPLYBODY{code,integer,required,}
The response code.

@RESTREPLYBODY{graph,object,required,graph_representation}
The information about the newly created graph.

@RESTRETURNCODE{202}
Is returned if the graph could be created and waitForSync is disabled
for the `_graphs` collection and not given in the request.
The response body contains the graph configuration that has been stored.

@RESTREPLYBODY{error,boolean,required,}
Flag if there was an error (true) or not (false).
It is false in this response.

@RESTREPLYBODY{code,integer,required,}
The response code.

@RESTREPLYBODY{graph,object,required,graph_representation}
The information about the newly created graph.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
Returned if the request is in a wrong format.

@RESTREPLYBODY{error,boolean,required,}
Flag if there was an error (true) or not (false).
It is true in this response.

@RESTREPLYBODY{code,integer,required,}
The response code.

@RESTREPLYBODY{errorNum,integer,required,}
ArangoDB error number for the error that occured.

@RESTREPLYBODY{errorMessage,string,required,}
A message created for this error.

@RESTRETURNCODE{403}
Returned if your user has insufficient rights.
In order to create a graph you at least need to have the following privileges:

  1. `Administrate` access on the Database.
  2. `Read Only` access on every collection used within this graph.

@RESTREPLYBODY{error,boolean,required,}
Flag if there was an error (true) or not (false).
It is true in this response.

@RESTREPLYBODY{code,integer,required,}
The response code.

@RESTREPLYBODY{errorNum,integer,required,}
ArangoDB error number for the error that occured.

@RESTREPLYBODY{errorMessage,string,required,}
A message created for this error.

@RESTRETURNCODE{409}
Returned if there is a conflict storing the graph.  This can occur
either if a graph with this name is already stored, or if there is one
edge definition with a the same
[edge collection](../../Manual/Appendix/Glossary.html#edge-collection) but a
different signature used in any other graph.

@RESTREPLYBODY{error,boolean,required,}
Flag if there was an error (true) or not (false).
It is true in this response.

@RESTREPLYBODY{code,integer,required,}
The response code.

@RESTREPLYBODY{errorNum,integer,required,}
ArangoDB error number for the error that occured.

@RESTREPLYBODY{errorMessage,string,required,}
A message created for this error.
