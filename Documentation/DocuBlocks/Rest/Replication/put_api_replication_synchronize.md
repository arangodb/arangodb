@RESTHEADER{PUT /_api/replication/sync, Synchronize data from a remote endpoint, handleCommandSync}

@RESTBODYPARAM{endpoint,string,required,string}
the master endpoint to connect to (e.g. "tcp://192.168.173.13:8529").

@RESTBODYPARAM{database,string,optional,string}
the database name on the master (if not specified, defaults to the
name of the local current database).

@RESTBODYPARAM{username,string,optional,string}
an optional ArangoDB username to use when connecting to the endpoint.

@RESTBODYPARAM{password,string,required,string}
the password to use when connecting to the endpoint.

@RESTBODYPARAM{includeSystem,boolean,optional,}
whether or not system collection operations will be applied

@RESTBODYPARAM{incremental,boolean,optional,}
if set to *true*, then an incremental synchronization method will be used
for synchronizing data in collections. This method is useful when
collections already exist locally, and only the remaining differences need
to be transferred from the remote endpoint. In this case, the incremental
synchronization can be faster than a full synchronization.
The default value is *false*, meaning that the complete data from the remote
collection will be transferred.

@RESTBODYPARAM{restrictType,string,optional,string}
an optional string value for collection filtering. When
specified, the allowed values are *include* or *exclude*.

@RESTBODYPARAM{restrictCollections,array,optional,string}
an optional array of collections for use with
*restrictType*. If *restrictType* is *include*, only the specified collections
will be sychronised. If *restrictType* is *exclude*, all but the specified
collections will be synchronized.

@RESTBODYPARAM{initialSyncMaxWaitTime,integer,optional,int64}
the maximum wait time (in seconds) that the initial synchronization will
wait for a response from the master when fetching initial collection data.
This wait time can be used to control after what time the initial synchronization
will give up waiting for a response and fail.
This value will be ignored if set to *0*.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Starts a full data synchronization from a remote endpoint into the local
ArangoDB database.

The *sync* method can be used by replication clients to connect an ArangoDB database
to a remote endpoint, fetch the remote list of collections and indexes, and collection
data. It will thus create a local backup of the state of data at the remote ArangoDB
database. *sync* works on a per-database level.

*sync* will first fetch the list of collections and indexes from the remote endpoint.
It does so by calling the *inventory* API of the remote database. It will then purge
data in the local ArangoDB database, and after start will transfer collection data
from the remote database to the local ArangoDB database. It will extract data from the
remote database by calling the remote database's *dump* API until all data are fetched.

In case of success, the body of the response is a JSON object with the following
attributes:

- *collections*: an array of collections that were transferred from the endpoint

- *lastLogTick*: the last log tick on the endpoint at the time the transfer
  was started. Use this value as the *from* value when starting the continuous
  synchronization later.

WARNING: calling this method will sychronize data from the collections found
on the remote endpoint to the local ArangoDB database. All data in the local
collections will be purged and replaced with data from the endpoint.

Use with caution!

**Note**: this method is not supported on a Coordinator in a cluster.
