@RESTHEADER{GET /_api/replication/applier-state, State of the replication applier}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Returns the state of the replication applier, regardless of whether the
applier is currently running or not.

The response is a JSON object with the following attributes:

- *state*: a JSON object with the following sub-attributes:

  - *running*: whether or not the applier is active and running

  - *lastAppliedContinuousTick*: the last tick value from the continuous
    replication log the applier has applied.

  - *lastProcessedContinuousTick*: the last tick value from the continuous
    replication log the applier has processed.

    Regularly, the last applied and last processed tick values should be
    identical. For transactional operations, the replication applier will first
    process incoming log events before applying them, so the processed tick
    value might be higher than the applied tick value. This will be the case
    until the applier encounters the *transaction commit* log event for the
    transaction.

  - *lastAvailableContinuousTick*: the last tick value the logger server can
    provide.

  - *time*: the time on the applier server.

  - *totalRequests*: the total number of requests the applier has made to the
    endpoint.

  - *totalFailedConnects*: the total number of failed connection attempts the
    applier has made.

  - *totalEvents*: the total number of log events the applier has processed.

  - *totalOperationsExcluded*: the total number of log events excluded because
    of *restrictCollections*.

  - *progress*: a JSON object with details about the replication applier progress.
    It contains the following sub-attributes if there is progress to report:

    - *message*: a textual description of the progress

    - *time*: the date and time the progress was logged

    - *failedConnects*: the current number of failed connection attempts

  - *lastError*: a JSON object with details about the last error that happened on
    the applier. It contains the following sub-attributes if there was an error:

    - *errorNum*: a numerical error code

    - *errorMessage*: a textual error description

    - *time*: the date and time the error occurred

    In case no error has occurred, *lastError* will be empty.

- *server*: a JSON object with the following sub-attributes:

  - *version*: the applier server's version

  - *serverId*: the applier server's id

- *endpoint*: the endpoint the applier is connected to (if applier is
  active) or will connect to (if applier is currently inactive)

- *database*: the name of the database the applier is connected to (if applier is
  active) or will connect to (if applier is currently inactive)

@EXAMPLES

Fetching the state of an inactive applier:

@EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_RUN{RestReplicationApplierStateNotRunning}
    var re = require("@arangodb/replication");
    re.applier.stop();

    var url = "/_api/replication/applier-state";
    var response = logCurlRequest('GET', url);

    assert(response.code === 200);
    logJsonResponse(response);
@END_EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_RUN

Fetching the state of an active applier:

@EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_RUN{RestReplicationApplierStateRunning}
    var re = require("@arangodb/replication");
    re.applier.stop();
    re.applier.start();

    var url = "/_api/replication/applier-state";
    var response = logCurlRequest('GET', url);
    re.applier.stop();

    assert(response.code === 200);
    logJsonResponse(response);
