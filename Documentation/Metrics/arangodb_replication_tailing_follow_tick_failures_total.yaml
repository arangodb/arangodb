  The number of replication tailing failures due to missing tick on leader.
troubleshoot:
  Action is required. Required follower ticks is not present (potentially
  removed) on a Leader DB-Server. Please check the related Leader DB-Server
  log-files to identify the origin of the cause. It may be required to do
  a full re-sync and/or increase the number of historic logfiles on the
  leader(s).
