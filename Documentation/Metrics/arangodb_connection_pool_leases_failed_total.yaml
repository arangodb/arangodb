description: |
  Total number of failed connection leases. There are two pools, one for
  the agency communication with label `AgencyComm` and one for the other
  cluster internal communication with label `ClusterComm`.
threshold: |
  A failed lease can happen if a connection has been terminated
  by some idle timeout or if it is already in use by some other request.
  Since this can happen under concurrent load, failed leases are not
  actually very worrying.
