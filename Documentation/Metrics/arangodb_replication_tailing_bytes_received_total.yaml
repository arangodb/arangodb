  Accumulated number of bytes received for replication tailing requests.
unit: bytes
type: counter
category: Replication
complexity: medium

description:
  The accumulated number of bytes received from a Leader for replication
  tailing requests. The higher the amount of bytes is, the more data
  is being processed afterwards on the Follower DB-Server.
troubleshoot:
  Compare this metric with all other related participating Follower
  DB-Servers. If the given value on a DB-Server is considerable higher,
  you might want to think about rebalancing your data as the overall
  work might not be evenly distributed.
