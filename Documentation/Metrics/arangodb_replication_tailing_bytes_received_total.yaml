  Accumulated number of bytes received for replication tailing requests.
unit: bytes
type: counter
category: Replication
complexity: medium
exposedBy:
  - dbserver
description:
  The accumulated number of bytes received from a leader for replication
  tailing requests. The higher the amount of bytes is, the more data
  is being processed afterwards on the follower dbserver.
troubleshoot:
  Compare this metric with all other related participating follower
  dbservers. If the given value on a dbserver is considerable higher,
  you might want to think about rebalancing your data as the overall
  work might not be evenly distributed.
