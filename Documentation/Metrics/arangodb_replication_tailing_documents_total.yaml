description:
  The accumulated number of replication tailing document inserts/replaces
  processed on a follower.
troubleshoot:
  Compare this metric with all other related participating follower
  dbservers. If the given value on a dbserver is considerable higher,
  you might want to think about rebalancing your data as the overall
  work might not be evenly distributed. It is important to understand
  that this metric only enumerates the amount of documents and does not
  compare document sizes. Even if values compared to other dbservers
  may vary, work load could be fine. Therefore also check the metric
  arangodb_replication_tailing_bytes_received_total to have an overall
  and more precise picture.
