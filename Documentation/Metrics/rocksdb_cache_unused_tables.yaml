description: |
  This metric reflects the current number of unused hash tables used by the
  in-memory cache which sits in front of RocksDB. Unused tables can be kept as
  backups to provide new, readily initialized tables for new caches.
  Unused tables can consume some memory, but the overall memory usage of
  unused tables is capped.
