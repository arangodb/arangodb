description: |
  Number of tasks/requests dropped because the client-specified queue time
  requirements, as indicated by client applications in the
  `x-arango-queue-time-seconds` HTTP request header could not be satisfied by
  the receiving server instance. This happens when the actual time needed to
  queue/dequeue requests on the scheduler queue exceeds the maximum time value
  that the client has specified in the request.
  Whenever this happens, the client application gets an HTTP 412 error 
  response back with error code 21004 ("queue time violated").
  Although the metric is exposed on all instance types, it is likely
  always `0` on DB-Servers, simply because Coordinators do not forward the
  `x-arango-queue-time-seconds` when they send internal requests to DB-Servers.
