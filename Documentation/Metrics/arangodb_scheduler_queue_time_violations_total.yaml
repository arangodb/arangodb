  Number of tasks/requests dropped and not added to internal queue
  due to the client-specified queue time requirements not being

description: |
  Number of tasks/requests dropped because the client-specified queue time
  requirements, as indicated by client applications in the request header
  "x-arango-queue-time-seconds" could not be satisfied by the receiving 
  server instance. This happens when the actual time need to queue/dequeue
  requests on the scheduler queue exceeds the maximum time value that the
  client has specified in the request. 
  Whenever this happens, the client application will get an HTTP 412 error 
  response back with error code 21004 ("queue time violated").
  Although the metric is exposed on all instance types, it will very likely
  always be 0 on DB servers, simply because coordinators do not forward the
  "x-arango-queue-time-seconds" when they send internal requests to DB
  servers.
