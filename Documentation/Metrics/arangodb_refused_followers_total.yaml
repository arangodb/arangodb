description: |
  Number of refusal answers from a follower during synchronous replication.
  A refusal answer will only be sent by a follower if the follower is under
  the impression that the replication request was not sent by the current
  shard leader. This can happen if replication requests to the follower are 
  delayed or the follower is slow to process incoming requests and there was 
  a leader change for the shard.
  If such a refusal answer is received by the shard leader, it will drop the
  follower from the list of followers.
  This metrics was named `arangodb_refused_followers_count` in previous
  versions of ArangoDB.
threshold: |
  Usually, refusal answers only occur if request processing on followers is 
  delayed and there was a recent leadership change. This should not be a
  common case and normally indicates a problem with the setup or with the load.
