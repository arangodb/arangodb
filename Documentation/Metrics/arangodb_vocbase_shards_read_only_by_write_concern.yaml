description: |
  Number of shards that are in read-only mode because there are not at least write concern many in-sync replicas.

  If this metrics has a value greater than 0, then some
  action is indicated. During an upgrade or when some DB-Server was
  restarted, it can happen that shard followers are out of sync and thus
  the write concern is undercut. Normally, shards should get in sync on
  their own, so observation and waiting is a good measure at first.
  However, if the situation persists, something is wrong, potentially
  some constant server crash (maybe out of memory crashes?) or another
  situation preventing shards to get in sync.
  Contact ArangoDB customer support in this case.
