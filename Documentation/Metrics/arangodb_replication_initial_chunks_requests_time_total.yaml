description: |
  This counter exhibits the accumulated wait time for replication key
  chunks determination requests, in milliseconds. This is part of the
  older (pre 3.8) initial replication protocol, which might still be used
  in 3.8 for collections which have been created by older versions.

  In this older protocol, the follower first fetches an overview over
  a shard from the leader. This does a full collection scan and
  divides the primary keys in the collection into equal sized chunks.
  Then, a checksum for each chunk is returned. The same is then done
  on the follower and the checksums are compared, chunk by chunk. For
  each chunk, for which the checksums do not match, the list of keys and
  revisions is fetched from the leader. This then enables the follower
  to fetch the actually needed documents and remove superfluous ones
  locally.

  This metric accumulates the time used for the initial step of getting
  the checksums for the key chunks.
