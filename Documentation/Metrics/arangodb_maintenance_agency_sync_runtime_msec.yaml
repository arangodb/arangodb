  Total time spent on agency sync.

description: |
  Database servers execute reconciliation actions to let the cluster converge
  to the desired state. To identify the target state differences in the meta
  data store provided by the agency are investigated and local changes are
  reported. This process is called agency sync and is executed in regular
  intervals.

  This metric tracks the runtime of individual agency syncs in a histogram.
  During DDL operations the runtime can increase but should generally be below
  1s.
