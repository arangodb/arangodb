description: |
  Total memory usage of all AQL queries currently executing.
  The granularity of this metric is steps of 32768 bytes. The current
  memory usage of all AQL queries will be compared against the configured
  limit in the `--query.global-memory-limit` startup option. 
  If the startup option has a value of `0`, then no global memory limit
  will be enforced. If the startup option has a non-zero value, queries
  will be aborted once the total query memory usage goes above the configured
  limit.
