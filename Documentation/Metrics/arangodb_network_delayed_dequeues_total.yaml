description: |
  Number of internal requests that had a delay of more than 1 second
  from submission to fuerte until they have been dequeued by the IO
  thread.
troubleshoot: |
  Such delays can be caused if the I/O threads for cluster internal
  communication are overwhelmed by traffic. Sometimes it can help to
  increase the number of such threads with the command line option
  `--network.io-threads`.
