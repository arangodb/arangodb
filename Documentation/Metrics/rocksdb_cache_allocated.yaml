description: |
  This metric reflects the current global allocation for the ArangoDB
  cache which sits in front of RocksDB. For example, the edge cache
  counts towards this allocation. All these caches together have a 
  global limit which can be controlled with the `--cache.size` option.
  See [the manual for details](https://www.arangodb.com/docs/stable/programs-arangod-options.html#cache).
