description: |
  Number of times a revision tree for a shard was completely
  rebuilt because of too many subsequent failures in the shard
  synchronization.
  If shards cannot get in sync after several attempts, the shard's
  revision tree is first rebuilt on the follower, and then on the
  leader. If the value is greater than zero, it means there have
  been shard synchronization failures.
