description: |
  Number of leader shards on this machine. Every shard has a leader and
  potentially multiple followers.
troubleshoot: |
  Since the leaders perform all the read and write operations and
  the followers only replicate the writes, one should usually have a
  relatively even distribution of leader shards across dbservers. An
  exception can be one-shard deployments, in which every collection has
  a single shard and all shards in a database must have the same leader.
  If you have few databases in a one-shard deployment, then an uneven
  distribution of leader shards is natural.
  
  You can either move shards manually, use the "Rebalance shards" button
  in the UI, or use the cluster maintenance tools in [this repository]
  (https://github.com/arangodb/cluster-maintenance) (`create-move-plan`
  and `execute-move-plan` specifically). In the latter case, contact
  ArangoDB customer support.
