description: |
  Number of agency read operations which were successful (i.e. completed
  without any error). Successful reads can only be executed on the leader, so
  this metric is supposed to increase only on agency leaders, but not on
  followers. Read requests that are executed on followers will be rejected
  and can be tracked via the metric `arangodb_agency_read_no_leader_total`.
  This metric was named `arangodb_agency_read_ok` in previous
  versions of ArangoDB.
