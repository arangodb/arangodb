description: |
  Followers of a replicated log, including the local followers for persistence
  each leader has, receive appendEntries requests. These contain log entries
  to be replicated. Serving these requests means writing them to persistence.

  This histogram counts the number of such requests server by this server,
  plus their respective runtime in microseconds.
