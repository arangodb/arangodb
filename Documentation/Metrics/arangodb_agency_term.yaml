description: |
  The Agency's current term.
threshold: |
  This number should usually not grow. If it does, the agency is doing
  repeated reelections, which suggests overload or bad network latency
  between agents.
troubleshoot: |
  It might help to reduce network latency between agents or move agent
  instances to separate machines.
