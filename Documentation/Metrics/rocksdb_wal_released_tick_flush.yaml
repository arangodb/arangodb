description: |
  This metric exposes the RocksDB WAL sequence number from which onwards 
  WAL files have to be kept because the WAL data could be used by external
  flushing needs. WAL files with sequence numbers higher than this value
  will not be garbage-collected.
  The candidates that can keep WAL files from being garbage-collected are
  arangosearch links or inverted indexes that are still syncing data,
  and background index creation.
