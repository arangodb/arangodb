  This counter exhibits the total number of documents fetched on the
  follower from the leader during initial synchronization of shards.
  This is part of the older (pre 3.8) initial replication protocol,
  which might still be used in 3.8 for collections which have been
  created by older versions.

  In this older protocol, the follower first fetches an overview over
  a shard from the leader. This does a full collection scan and
  divides the primary keys in the collection into equal sized chunks.
  Then, a checksum for each chunk is returned. The same is then done
  on the follower and the checksums are compared, chunk by chunk. For
  each chunk, for which the checksums do not match, the list of keys and
  revisions is fetched from the leader. This then enables the follower
  to fetch the actually needed documents and remove superfluous ones
  locally.

  This metric accumulates the total number of documents fetched from the
  leader in the third step.
