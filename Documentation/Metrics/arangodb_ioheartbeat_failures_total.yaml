description: |
  This counter is increased whenever the io heartbeat encounters a problem
  when writing a small file to the database directory, reading it and then
  removing it again. This test is done
  periodically to ensure that the underlying volume is usable. The test can
  be switched off explicitly with the flag `--database.io-heartbeat=false`,
  but the default is `true`. Furthermore, every such failure leads to a
  line in the log at INFO level for the `ENGINES` topic.
