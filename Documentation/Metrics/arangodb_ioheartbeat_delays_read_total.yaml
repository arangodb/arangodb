description: |
  This counter is increased whenever the io heartbeat encounters a delay
  of at least 1s when reading a small file in the database directory.
  This test is periodically to ensure that the underlying volume is
  readable and performs reasonably well. The test can be switched off
  explicitly with the flag `--database.io-heartbeat=false`, but the
  default is `true`. Furthermore, every such failure leads to a line in
  the log at INFO level for the `ENGINES` topic.
