description: |
  This counter is increased whenever the io heartbeat encounters a problem
  when removing a small file in the database directory. This test is done
  regularly to ensure that the underlying volume is writable. The test can
  be switched off explicitly with the flag `--database.io-heartbeat=false`,
  but the default is `true`. Furthermore, every such failure leads to a
  line in the log at INFO level for the `ENGINES` topic.
