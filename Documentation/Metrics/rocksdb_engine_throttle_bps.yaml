description: |
  This metric exposes the current write rate limit of the ArangoDB
  RocksDB throttle. The throttle limits the write rate to allow
  RocksDB's background threads to catch up with compactions and not
  fall behind too much, since this would in the end lead to nasty
  write stops in RocksDB and incur considerable delays. If `0` is
  shown, no throttling happens, otherwise, you see the current
  write rate limit in bytes per second. Also see the `--rocksdb.*`
  startup options.
