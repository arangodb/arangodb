description: |
  Total number of failed heartbeat transmissions.
  Servers in a cluster periodically send their heartbeats to
  the Agency to report their own liveliness. This counter gets
  increased whenever sending such a heartbeat fails. In the single
  server, this counter is only used in the Active Failover deployment mode.
threshold: |
  It is a bad sign for health if heartbeat transmissions fail. This can
  lead to failover actions which are ultimately bad for the service.
troubleshoot: |
  This can be a sign of overload or of bad network connectivity. Potentially
  move the Agent instances to separate machines.
