description: |
  Total number of failed heartbeat transmissions.
threshold: |
  It is a bad sign for health if heartbeat transmissions fail. This can
  lead to failover actions which are ultimately bad for the service.
troubleshoot: |
  This can be a sign of overload or of bad network connectivity. Potentially
  move the agent instances to separate machines.
