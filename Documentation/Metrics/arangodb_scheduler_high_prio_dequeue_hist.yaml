description: |
  This histogram provides the distribution of time required to take entries
  from the high priority queue, i.e., the amount of time the jobs were sitting
  in the queue. Long dequeue times indicate that the server is under heavy load
  and high priority jobs cannot be dequeued in a timely manner.
