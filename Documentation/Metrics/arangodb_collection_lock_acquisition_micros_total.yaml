description: |
  Total amount of time it took to acquire collection/shard locks for
  write operations, summed up for all collections/shards. Will not be increased 
  for any read operations.
  The value is measured in microseconds.
troubleshoot: |
  In case this value is considered too high, check if there are AQL queries
  or transactions that use exclusive locks on collections, and try to reduce them. 
  Operations using exclusive locks may lock out other queries/transactions temporarily, 
  which will lead to an increase in lock acquisition time.
