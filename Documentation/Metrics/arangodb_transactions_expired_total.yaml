description: |
  Total number of expired transactions, i.e. transactions that have
  been begun but that were automatically garbage-collected due to 
  inactivity within the transactions' time-to-live (TTL) period.
  In the cluster, this metric will be collected separately for transactions 
  on coordinators and the transaction counterparts on leaders and followers.
  This metric was named `arangodb_transactions_expired` in previous
  versions of ArangoDB.
