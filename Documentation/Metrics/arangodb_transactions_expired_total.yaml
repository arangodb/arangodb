description: |
  Total number of expired transactions, i.e. transactions that have
  been begun but that were automatically garbage-collected due to
  inactivity within the transactions' time-to-live (TTL) period.
  In the cluster, this metric is collected separately for transactions
  on Coordinators and the transaction counterparts on leaders and followers.
  This metric was named `arangodb_transactions_expired` in previous
  versions of ArangoDB.
