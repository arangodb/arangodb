description: |
  Total number of V8 context enter failures. A context receives a context
  enter event every time it begins to execute some JavaScript. If no
  context is available at such a time the system waits for 60s for a
  context to become free. If this does not happen within the 60s, the
  context enter event fails, a warning is logged and this counter is
  increased by one.
threshold: |
  If you see V8 context enter failures, then you do not have enough
  V8 contexts or the server is overloaded by JavaScript tasks. If some
  JavaScript code blocks V8 contexts for too long, the free V8 contexts
  can run out and these failures begin to happen.
