description: |
  Current number of active AQL query cursors.
  AQL query cursors are created for queries that produce
  more results than specified in the `batchSize` query option
  (default value: 1000). Such results can be fetched incrementally
  by client operations in chunks.
  As it is unclear if and when a client will fetch any remaining
  data from a cursor, every cursor has a server-side timeout value
  (TTL) after which it is garbage-collected.
troubleshoot: |
  This number can grow temporary in case a lot of concurrent AQL queries
  are executed. It should go down again however when the query results
  are consumed.
  If this number does not decrease a lot, it means that cursors are kept
  on the server and wait for their expiry.
  As active cursors can use resources (memory for query results and
  potentially some collection locks), it is advisable to check the client
  application code for ttl values and also check if the client application
  code fully consumes query results or only fetches them partially.
