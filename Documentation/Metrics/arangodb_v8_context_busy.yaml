description: |
  Number of V8 contexts currently busy, that means, they are currently
  working on some JavaScript task. Normally, only coordinators and
  single servers should have V8 contexts, for dbservers and agents the
  value is always zero.
threshold: |
  If this number is close to the maximum allowed number of V8 contexts,
  there might be a shortage. This can delay Foxx queries and AQL
  user defined functions. On the other hand, V8 contexts can use
  quite a lot of memory, so one should not have too many if RAM
  is scarce.
