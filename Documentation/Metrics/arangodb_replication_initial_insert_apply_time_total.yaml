  Accumulated time needed to apply replication initial sync insertions.
  This counter exhibits the accumulated wait time for actually inserting
  documents for the initial synchronization, in milliseconds. This is
  part of the older (pre 3.8) initial replication protocol, which might
  still be used in 3.8 for collections which have been created by older
  versions.

  In this older protocol, the follower first fetches an overview over
  a shard from the leader. This does a full collection scan and
  divides the primary keys in the collection into equal sized chunks.
  Then, a checksum for each chunk is returned. The same is then done
  on the follower and the checksums are compared, chunk by chunk. For
  each chunk, for which the checksums do not match, the list of keys and
  revisions is fetched from the leader. This then enables the follower
  to fetch the actually needed documents and remove superfluous ones
  locally.

  This metric accumulates the time used for the actual insertion of
  replicated documents on the follower.
