description: |
  Amount of memory used to represent the agency data structure. This measures memory usage on agents 
  and also on Coordinators and DB servers, because these have a cached version of the agency's
  `Plan` and `Current` sections. On agency followers this metric normally
  remains at a low value because the agency key/value store is only built on
  agency leaders.
  This metric can be non-zero even on single servers because there is a small initial memory allocation
  made at ArangoDB instance start.
