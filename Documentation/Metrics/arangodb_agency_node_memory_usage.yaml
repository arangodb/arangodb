description: |
  Amount of memory used to represent the Agency data structure. This measures
  memory usage on Agents, and also on Coordinators and DB-Servers because these
  have a cached version of the Agency's `Plan` and `Current` sections.
  
  On Agency followers, this metric normally remains at a low value because the
  Agency key/value store is only built on Agency leaders.

  This metric can be non-zero even on single servers because there is a small
  initial memory allocation made at ArangoDB instance start.
