  Lifetime hit rate of the ArangoDB cache in front of RocksDB

description: |
  This metric reflects the lifetime hit rate of the ArangoDB in-memory
  cache which is sitting in front of RocksDB. For example, the edge
  cache is a part of this. The value will be a ratio between 0 and 1.
  "Lifetime" means here that accounting is done from the most recent
  start of the `arangod` instance.
  If the hit rate is too low, you might have to little RAM available
  for the in-memory caches.
