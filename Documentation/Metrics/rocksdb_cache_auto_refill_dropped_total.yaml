description: |
  This metric shows the total number of index entries for which no automatic
  refilling happened in their in-memory caches. 
  This counter will be increased only for insert, update and replace operations
  into appropriate indexes with in-memory caches and requested automatic refilling, 
  if no refill operation could be queued due to capacity constraints.
  A refill operation request can be rejected if the number of currently queued
  refill operations exceeds the maximum value configured via the startup option
  `--rocksdb.auto-refill-index-cache-queue-capacity`.
  Correctness of index lookups is not affected if this metric is non-zero, as
  it only reports the number of failed refilling attempts in the in-memory cache(s)
  of any index. These in-memory caches are optional and their fill grade does not
  affect correctness.
troubleshoot: |
  If this metric keeps increasing, it indicates that the index refill background 
  thread can't keep up with the incoming data modification requests. 
  In this case, consider increasing the background thread's queueing capacity via
  the startup option `--rocksdb.auto-refill-index-cache-queue-capacity`.
  Increasing the capacity will help to handle bursts of request, but will not help
  if the background thread is overwhelmed by a continuous high load.
