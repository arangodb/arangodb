description: |
  This metric shows the total number of index entries for which no automatic
  refilling happened in their in-memory caches. 
  This counter will be increased only for insert, update and replace operations
  into appropriate indexes with in-memory caches and requested automatic refilling, 
  if no refill operation could be queued due to capacity constraints.
  A refill operation request can be rejected if the number of currently queued
  refill operations exceeds the maximum value configured via the startup option
  `--rocksdb.auto-refill-index-cache-queue-capacity`.
  Correctness of index lookups is not affected if this metric is non-zero, as
  it only reports the number of failed refilling attempts in the in-memory cache(s)
  of any index. These in-memory caches are optional and their fill grade does not
  affect correctness.
troubleshoot: |
  If this metric keeps increasing, consider increasing the value of the startup
  option `--rocksdb.auto-refill-index-cache-queue-capacity`.
