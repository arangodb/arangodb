  This counter exhibits the total number of times documents have been
  fetched on the follower from the leader during initial synchronization
  of shards. This is part of the older (pre 3.8) initial replication
  protocol, which might still be used in 3.8 for collections which have
  been created by older versions.

  In this older protocol, the follower first fetches an overview over
  a shard from the leader. This does a full collection scan and
  divides the primary keys in the collection into equal sized chunks.
  Then, a checksum for each chunk is returned. The same is then done
  on the follower and the checksums are compared, chunk by chunk. For
  each chunk, for which the checksums do not match, the list of keys and
  revisions is fetched from the leader. This then enables the follower
  to fetch the actually needed documents and remove superfluous ones
  locally.

  This metric accumulates the total number of times documents have been
  fetched from the leader in the third step.
