description: |
  Total memory usage of connection statistics. 
  If the startup option `--server.statistics` is set to `true`, then some
  connection statistics are built up in memory for every connection that is
  made to the arangod server.
  It is expected that the memory usage reported by this metric remains
  relatively constant over time. It should grow only when there are bursts of 
  new connections.
  Some memory is pre-allocated at startup for higher efficiency.
  No memory will be allocated for connection statistics if the startup option
  is set to `false`.
