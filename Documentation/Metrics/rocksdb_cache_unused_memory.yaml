  Global current memory allocation of inactive/reserve hash tables in ArangoDB cache.

description: |
  This metric reflects the current memory allocation for unused hash tables 
  used by the in-memory cache which sits in front of RocksDB. Unused tables 
  can be kept as backups to provide new, readily initialized tables for new 
  caches. The overall memory usage of unused tables is capped by the system,
  so it will not grow overly large.
