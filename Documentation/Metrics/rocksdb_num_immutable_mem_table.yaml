description: |
  This metric exhibits the RocksDB metric "num-immutable-mem-table", 
  which shows the number of immutable memtables that have not yet been
  flushed. This value is the sum over all column families.

  Memtables are sorted tables of key/value pairs which begin
  to be built up in memory. At some stage they are closed and become
  immutable, and some time later they are flushed to disk.
