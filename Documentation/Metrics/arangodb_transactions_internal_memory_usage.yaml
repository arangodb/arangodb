description: |
  Total memory usage of currently ongoing transactions that were started
  by end users. 
  This includes transactions explicitly started via the transactions API, 
  but also auto-commit single and multi-document operations that were not 
  explicitly wrapped into a transaction by the end user.
  Excluded from this metric are top-level AQL queries, whose memory usage
  is tracked in a seperate metric `arangodb_aql_global_memory_usage`.
