description: |
  Total memory usage of all index selectivity estimates.
  The metric includes memory used for buffering index write 
  operations that still have to be applied.
  Index selectivity estimates are used for edge indexes and
  persistent indexes.
  On coordinators, this metric will always have a value of 0.
troubleshoot: |
  Persistent indexes can be created with selectivity
  estimates turned off to save a bit of memory and slightly
  improve index write performance.
