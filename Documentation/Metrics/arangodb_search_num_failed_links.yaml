description: |
  Number of currently of failed arangosearch links and
  inverted indexes. A link or inverted index can be set 
  to failed if the recovery for it is intentionally skipped.
  A failed link/inverted index cannot be used for querying
  and should be recreated.
troubleshoot: |
  If this metric contains a value greater than zero, the
  log files should be checked to find out which links/indexes
  should be recreated. The failed links/indexes should then
  be dropped and later recreated.
