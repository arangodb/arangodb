  ArangoSearch columns cache usage.

description: |
  Size of all ArangoSearch columns currently loaded into the cache.
troubleshoot: |
  If this metric contains a value close to configured
  `--arangosearch.columns-cache-limit`, there might be columns 
  that are marked to be cached but do not fit into the cache.
  That may result in query performance degradation. Check the
  log for pattern "Failed to allocate memory for buffered column"
