description: |
  Number of outgoing internal requests in flight. This metric is increased
  whenever any cluster-internal request is about to be sent via the underlying
  connection pool, and is decreased whenever a response for such a request is
  received or the request runs into a timeout.
  This metric provides an estimate of the fan-out of operations. For example,
  a user operation on a collection with a single shard normally leads to
  a single internal request (plus replication), whereas an operation on a
  collection with 10 shards may lead to a fan-out of 10 (plus replication).
