description: |
  Number of transactions using sequential locking of collections to avoid deadlocking.
  By default, a Coordinator tries to lock all shards of a collection in parallel.
  This approach is normally fast but can cause deadlocks with other transactions that
  lock the same shards in a different order. In case such a deadlock is detected, the
  Coordinator aborts the lock round and starts a new one that locks all shards in
  sequential order. This avoids deadlocks, but has a higher setup overhead.
troubleshoot: |
  In case this value is increasing, check if there are AQL queries or transactions that
  use exclusive locks on collections, and try to reduce them.
  Operations using exclusive locks may lock out other queries/transactions temporarily,
  which can lead to (temporary) deadlocks in case the queries/transactions
  are run on multiple shards on different servers.
