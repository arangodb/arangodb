description: |
  Counter for FailedServer jobs. This counter is increased whenever a 
  supervision run encounters a failed server and starts a FailedServer job.
  This metric was named `arangodb_agency_supervision_failed_server_count`
  in previous versions of ArangoDB.
threshold: |
  Many FailedServer jobs indicate frequent failures of dbservers. This
  is generally not good.
troubleshoot: |
  Find the root cause of server failures. Overload and bad network latency
  can lead to misdetected server failures.
