description: |
  Number of times a follower shard synchronization attempt ran into the
  timeout controlled by the startup option `--cluster.shard-synchronization-attempt-timeout`.
  Running into this timeout is not an error. The timeout simply restricts
  individual shard synchronization attempts to a certain maximum runtime.
  When it happens, the shard synchronization attempt is aborted by the
  follower, but immediately retried afterwards. This abort-and-retry
  operation allows the leader DB servers to purge their archived WAL files
  for the aborted snapshots timely, so that long-running shard synchronization
  aborts do not lead to overly long WAL file retention periods on leaders.
