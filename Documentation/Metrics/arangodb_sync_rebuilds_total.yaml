description: |
  Number of times a follower shard needed to be completely rebuilt 
  because of too many subsequent shard synchronization failures.
  If this metric is non-zero, it means that a follower shard could
  not get in sync with the leader even after many attempts. When 
  the metric gets increased, the follower shard is dropped and 
  completely rebuilt from leader data, in order to increase its 
  chances of getting in sync.

  Normally, this number will always be 0. If it is not, then something
  is wrong, please contact ArangoDB customer support in this case.
