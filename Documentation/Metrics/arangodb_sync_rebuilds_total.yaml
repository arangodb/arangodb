description: |
  Number of times a follower shard needed to be completely rebuilt
  because of too many subsequent shard synchronization failures.
  This metric is always zero from version 3.9.3 onwards. In previous
  releases, a non-zero value indicates that a follower shard could
  not get in sync with the leader even after many attempts. When
  the metric got increased, the follower shard was dropped and
  completely rebuilt from leader data, in order to increase its
  chances of getting in sync.

  This number will always be 0 from version 3.9.3 onwards. If it is
  non-zero in previous versions, then something is wrong, please 
  contact ArangoDB customer support in this case.
