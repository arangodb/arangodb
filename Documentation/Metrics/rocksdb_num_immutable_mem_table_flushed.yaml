  This metric exhibits the RocksDB metric `num-immutable-mem-table-flushed`,
  which shows the number of immutable memtables that have already been
  flushed. This value is the sum over all column families.

  Memtables are sorted tables of key/value pairs which begin
  to be built up in memory. At some stage they are closed and become
  immutable, and some time later they are flushed to disk.
