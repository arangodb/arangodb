  Agency RAFT follower append time histogram
unit: ms
type: histogram
category: Agency
complexity: medium
exposedBy:
  - agent
description: |
  This measures the time an agency follower needs for individual
  append operations resulting from `AppendEntriesRPC` requests.
  Every event contributes a measurement to the histogram, which
  also exposes the number of events and the total sum of all
  measurements.
threshold: |
  Normally these times should be clearly sub-second.
troubleshoot: |
  If you see delays here, the agents might not have enough IO bandwidth
  or might be overloaded. Try to provision more IOPS or more CPU capacity,
  potentially moving agents to separate machines.
