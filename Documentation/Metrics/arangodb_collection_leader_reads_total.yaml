description: |
  This metric exposes the number of per-shard read operation requests on DB-Servers.
  It is increased by AQL queries and single-/multi-document read operations.

  An AQL query will increase the counter exactly once for a shard that is involved
  in the query in read-only mode, regardless if and how many documents/edges the
  query actually reads from the shard. For shards that are accessed by an AQL query
  in read/write mode, only the write counter will be increased.

  For every single- or multi-document read operation, the counter will be
  increased exactly once for each shard that is affected by the operation, even
  if multiple documents are read from the same shard.
  
  This metric is not exposed by default. It is only present if the startup option 
  `--server.export-shard-usage-metrics` is set to either `enabled-per-shard` or
  `enabled-per-shard-per-user`. With the former setting, the metric will have
  different labels for each shard that was read from. With the latter setting,
  the metric will have different labels for each combination of shard and user
  that accessed the shard.
