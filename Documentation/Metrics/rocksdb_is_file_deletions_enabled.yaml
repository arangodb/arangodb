  This metric exhibits the RocksDB metric "rocksdb-is-file-deletions-enabled".
  It shows 0 if deletion of obsolete files is enabled, and otherwise,
  it shows a non-zero number. Note that for ArangoDB, this is supposed
  to always return 1, since the deletion of obsolete WAL files is done
  from ArangoDB, externally to RocksDB.
