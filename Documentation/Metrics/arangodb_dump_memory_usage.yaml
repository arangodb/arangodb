description: |
  This metric shows the current memory usage of all ongoing parallel 
  arangodump operations that are ongoing on the server. It will
  be increased whenever the server-side part of arangodump requests
  a large block of memory for storing dump results. It will only be
  increased on servers that host at least one of the collections/shards
  that is part of the dump.
  The value will be decreased whenever a dump result was successfully
  transfered to arangodump and arangodump has acknowledged its reception.
  The value will also go down when the server-side part of an abandoned 
  arangodump operation time out and all its data is removed from memory.
  
  This metric will have a value of 0 on coordinators. The metric will
  not be increased for any arangodump invocations that did not use the
  `--parallel-dump` option.
troubleshoot: |
  If the peak values reported by this metric are close to the memory
  limit configured via the startup option `--dump.max-memory-usage`,
  this indicates that dumps could operate faster when given more
  memory resources. In this case either increase the value of the
  startup option, which allows the server-side part of arangodump to
  buffer more results in memory, or reduce the number of batches to 
  prefetch when invoking arangodump. 
    
  Note also that values reported by this metric may temporarily be
  slightly above the configured memory usage limit to guarantee
  progress of dump operations.
