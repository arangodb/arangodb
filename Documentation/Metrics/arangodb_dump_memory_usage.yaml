description: |
  This metric shows the current memory usage of all ongoing parallel 
  arangodump operations that are ongoing on the server. It will
  be increased whenever the server-side part of arangodump requests
  a large block of memory for storing dump results. It will only be
  increased on servers that host at least one of the collections/shards
  that is part of the dump.
  The value will be decreased whenever a dump result was successfully
  transfered to arangodump and arangodump has acknowledged its reception.
  The value will also go down when the server-side part of an abandoned 
  arangodump operation time out and all its data is removed from memory.
  This metric will have a value of 0 on coordinators. The metric will
  not be increased for any arangodump invocations that did not use the
  `--parallel-dump` option.
