description: |
  Histogram of `Current` loading runtimes, i.e. the runtimes
  of the `ClusterInfo::loadCurrent` internal method. Provides a
  distribution of all loading times for the `Current`
  section of the agency data. The `Current` section gets
  loaded on server startup, and then gets reloaded on servers 
  only for any databases in which there have been recent structural 
  changes (i.e. DDL changes).
troubleshoot: |
  In case this histogram contains very high loading times, this
  may be due to using many collections or many shards inside a
  database for which there are often structural changes. It then
  may make sense to reduce the number of collections or number
  of shards. Note that this can have other effects, so it requires
  an informed decision.
