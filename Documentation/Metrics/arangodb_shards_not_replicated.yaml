description: |
  Number of shards not replicated at all. This is counted for all shards
  for which this server is currently the leader. The number is increased
  by one for every shards for which no follower is in sync.
troubleshoot: |
  Needless to say, such a situation is very bad for resilience, since it
  indicates a single point of failure. So, if this number is larger than 0,
  then some action is indicated. During an upgrade or when some dbserver
  was restarted, it can happen that shard followers are out of sync.
  Normally, shards should get in sync on their own, so observation
  and waiting is a good measure at first. However, if the situation
  persists, something is wrong, potentially some constant server crash
  (maybe out of memory crashes?) or another situation preventing
  shards to get in sync. Contact ArangoDB customer support in this case.
