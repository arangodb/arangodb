description: |
  Agency compaction time histogram. Provides a distribution
  of agency compaction run times. Compactions are triggered after
  `--agency.compaction-keep-size` entries have accumulated in the
  RAFT log.
troubleshoot: |
  If compaction takes too long, it may be useful to reduce the number
  of log entries to keep in `--agency.compaction-keep-size`.
