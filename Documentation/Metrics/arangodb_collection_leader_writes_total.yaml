description: |
  This metric exposes the number of per-shard write operation requests on DB-Servers.
  It is increased by AQL queries and single-/multi-document write operations.

  An AQL query increases the counter exactly once for a shard that is involved
  in the query in write-only or read-write mode, regardless if and how many
  documents/edges are inserted or modified in the shard.

  For every single- or multi-document write operation, the counter is
  increased exactly once for each shard that is affected by the operation, even
  if multiple documents are inserted, modified, or removed from the same shard.

  For collection truncate operations, the counter is also increased exactly once for
  each shard affected by the truncate.
  
  This metric is not exposed by default. It is only present if the startup option
  `--server.export-shard-usage-metrics` is set to either `enabled-per-shard` or 
  `enabled-per-shard-per-user`. With the former setting, the metric has different 
  labels for each shard that was read from. With the latter setting, the metric 
  has different labels for each combination of shard and user that accessed the shard.
  The metric is only exposed on DB servers and not on Coordinators or single servers.
  
  Note that internal operations, such as internal queries executed for statistics
  gathering, internal garbage collection, and TTL index cleanup are not counted in
  these metrics. Additionally, all requests that use the superuser JWT for
  authentication and that do not have a specific user set, are not counted.
  Requests are also only counted if they have an ArangoDB user associated with them,
  so that the cluster must also be running with authentication turned on.
