description: |
  This metric exposes the number of per-shard write operation requests on DB-Servers.
  It is increased by AQL queries and single-/multi-document write operations.

  An AQL query will increase the counter exactly once for a shard that is involved
  in the query in write-only or read-write mode, regardless if and how many documents/edges
  will insert or modify in the shard.

  For every single- or multi-document write operation, the counter will be
  increased exactly once for each shard that is affected by the operation, even
  if multiple documents are inserted, modified or removed from the same shard.

  For collection truncate operations, the counter is also increased exactly once for
  each shard affected by the truncate.
  
  This metric is not exposed by default. It is only present if the startup option 
  `--server.export-shard-usage-metrics` is set to either `enabled-per-shard` or
  `enabled-per-shard-per-user`. With the former setting, the metric will have
  different labels for each shard that was read from. With the latter setting,
  the metric will have different labels for each combination of shard and user
  that accessed the shard.
