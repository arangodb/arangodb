description: |
  Number of internal requests that had a response which took - after the
  request was sent out - more than 61 seconds to return. Note that this
  threshold intentionally ignores the long poll requests to the agency,
  which return exactly after 60 seconds.

  If this counter moves we either have cluster-internal requests which
  take a long time to execute on the other side, in which case they
  are totally normal. But in the absence of such requests it is a sign
  for delayed network traffic if this counter moves.
