  Number of failed connection attempts and response errors during initial asynchronous replication.
unit: number
type: counter
category: Replication
complexity: medium
exposedBy:
  - dbserver
description: |
  During initial replication the existing data from the leader is copied asynchronously
  over to new shards. Whenever there is a communication issue between the follower and
  the leader of the shard it will be counted here for the follower. This communication
  issues cover failed connections or http errors, but they also cover invalid or
  unexpected data formats received on the follower.
threshold: |
  In ideal situation this counter should be 0. It is expected to increase if there is
  server or network outage. However it is not guaranteed that this metric increases
  in such a situation.
troubleshoot: |
  If this counter increases this typically indicates an issue with the communication
  between servers. If it is just occasionally an increase of one, it can be a simple
  network hiccup, if you see constant increases here that indicates serious issues.
  This also indicates that there is a shard trying to get into sync with the existing
  data, which cannot make progress. So you have only replicationFactor - 1 copies of
  the data right now. If more servers suffer outage you may lose data in this case.
  * First thing to check: Network connectivity, make sure all servers are online
    and the machines can communicate to one-another.
  * Second: Check ArangoDB logs of this server for more details, most likely
    you will see WARN or ERROR messages in "replication" log topic. If you contact
    ArangoDB support for this issue, it will help to include this servers logs as well.
  * Third: (Unlikely) If the logs contain unexpected format or value entries
    please check if you are running all ArangoDB Database servers within the same
    version of ArangoDB. Only upgrades of one minor version at a time are supported
    in general, so if you are running one server with a much newer / older version
    please upgrade all servers to the newest version.
  * Forth: If none of the above applies, please contact ArangoDB Support.
