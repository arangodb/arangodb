  Number of internal requests for which sending off was completed but
  delayed for more than 3 seconds.
troubleshoot: |
  If this counter moves it is a sign that either the network infrastructure
  delays sending out of cluster-internal requests or that the receiving
  side cannot accept the traffic fast enough. In case of very large requests
  it is normal that sending takes longer than 3 seconds.
