description: |
  This counter reflects the number of times RocksDB was observed by
  ArangoDB to have entered a stalled (slowed) write state.
  
  If the RocksDB background threads which do cleanup and compaction
  cannot keep up with the writing, then RocksDB first throttles its
  write rate ("write stall") and later stops the writing entirely
  ("write stop"). Both are suboptimal, since the write rate is too high.
threshold: |
  If this number grows, you are probably writing faster to ArangoDB than
  RocksDB can keep up with its background processing. This is OK for
  a while, but might eventually lead to actual write stops, which are
  bad since they can lead to unavailability.
troubleshoot: |
  Quite often, RocksDB is limited by the available I/O bandwidth. Sometimes,
  it is not the bandwidth itself, but the number of I/O operations per
  second (IOPS) which is limited. If you are in a cloud environment,
  IOPS are often scarce (or expensive) and you might be able to
  deploy more.
