description: |
  This histogram is updated whenever the io heartbeat runs its test in
  the database directory. It writes a small file, syncs it to durable
  storage, reads it, and then unlinks the file again. This test is done
  periodically to ensure that the underlying volume is usable and performs
  reasonably well. The test can be switched off explicitly with the flag
  `--database.io-heartbeat=false`, but the default is `true`.
