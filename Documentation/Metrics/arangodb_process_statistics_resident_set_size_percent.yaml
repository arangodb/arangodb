description: |
  The relative size of the number of pages the process has in real
  memory compared to system memory. This is just the pages which count
  toward text, data, or stack space. This does not include pages which
  have not been demand-loaded in, or which are swapped out. The value is a
  ratio between 0.00 and 1.00.
