description: |
  The relative size of the number of pages the process has in real
  memory compared to system memory. This is just the pages which count
  toward text, data, or stack space. This does not include pages which
  have not been demand-loaded in, or which are swapped out. The value is a
  ratio between 0.00 and 1.00.
threshold: |
  This value can be consistently relatively high, even when not under load,
  due to different caches like the RocksDB block cache or the edge cache. There
  should be some safety margin left, so it should not get too close to 1.
troubleshooting: |
  If the memory is nearly full, this can lead to performance degradation, errors
  because queries can't be executed, or the process being killed by the
  operating system to free memory. This can be mitigated by adding more memory,
  decreasing the size of caches if they aren't much needed, or restricting the
  amount of memory AQL queries may use.
