  Aggregated wait time for replication tailing requests.
troubleshoot:
  If you see unusual spikes here, please inspect potential
  network issues. It may help to increase network bandwith
  and/or reduce network latency. In case there are no network
  issues, also check the load of the serving leader dbserver,
  as well as the follower dbserver, as they could potentially
  be overloaded and reaching hardware-based limits.
