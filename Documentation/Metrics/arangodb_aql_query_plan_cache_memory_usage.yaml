description: |
  Total memory usage of all query plan caches across all databases.
  The gauge is changed whenever a query plan is added or removed from
  a query plan cache. Note that there is a limit of entries for each
  query plan cache and a limit to its memory usage, however, this limit
  is only per database. There is currently no global limit for all
  databases.
