description: |
  This metric reflects the current amount of memory in bytes consumed by
internal transactions in arangod, i.e. transactions that weren't triggered
by a user command or transaction. It's considered to be in the RocksDB category
because its value is increased/decreased whenever there's an insertion or 
deletion into RocksDB memory table.
