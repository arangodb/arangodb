  Total number of log messages that were dropped by the logger.

  Log messages that are produced by worker threads are pushed into a log
  queue that is owned by a dedicated logger thread. This dedicated log
  thread is then responsible for writing the log messages out to disk or
  stdout asynchronously.
  As there can be many threads that produce log messages, but only one
  thread that consumes and logs messages from the log queue, it is possible
  that the log queue grows too large, potentially consuming a lot of
  memory to buffer all non-consumed log messages in RAM.
  In order to prevent the log queue from using too much memory, its size
  is bounded. The startup option `--log.max-queued-entries` controls the
  maximum size of the log queue.
  Whenever the log queue has reached its capacity limit and a log producer
  thread tries to push a log message to the log queue, the log message
  will be dropped. For every dropped log message this metric will be 
  increased by one, so it becomes visible that log messages were dropped.

  In case this metric is greater than one, there is too much logging
  going on for the log thread to keep up with incoming log messages. There
  are two ways to counteract this. 
  Either the log levels needed to be lowered (e.g. from "trace" to "debug"
  or from "debug" to "info"), or the maximum capacity of the log queue
  needs to be increased. This can be achieved by adjusting the value of
  the startup option `--log.max-queued-entries` to a higher value.
