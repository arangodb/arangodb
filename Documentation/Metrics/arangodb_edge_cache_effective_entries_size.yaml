description: |
  Total effective memory size of all edge cache data that were ever stored in
  the edge cache of any collection/shard. The size is calculated after any
  potential compression, so the compression efficiency can be estimated by 
  this metric by the size of the uncompressed edge cache entries.
  Note that this metric is incremented upon every edge cache insert attempt.
  It is increased also when data cannot be inserted into the cache (e.g. because
  the cache had no memory left). The metric is not decreased when data gets 
  evicted from the cache.
