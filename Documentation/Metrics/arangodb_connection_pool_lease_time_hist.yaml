description: |
  Time to lease a connection from the connection pool. There are two pools,
  one for the agency communication with label `AgencyComm` and one for
  the other cluster internal communication with label `ClusterComm`.
threshold: |
  Leasing connections from the pool should be fast, unless a new connection
  has to be formed, which can easily take (in particular with TLS) several
  milliseconds. If times are a lot higher, then some underlying network
  problem might be there.
