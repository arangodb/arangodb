description: |
  Number of internal requests that have timed out. This metric is increased
  whenever any cluster-internal request executed in the underlying connection
  pool runs into a timeout.
troubleshoot: |
  Request timeouts can be caused by the destination servers being overloaded
  and thus slow to respond, or by network errors. If this counter increases,
  it is advised to check network connectivity and server loads.
