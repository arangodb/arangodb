description: |
  This counter reflects the total number of HTTP requests
  that have been authenticated for some user (as opposed to with the
  JWT superuser token), which have hit this particular instance of
  `arangod`.
  
  Note that this counter is ever growing during the lifetime of the
  `arangod` process. However, when the process is restarted, it starts
  from scratch. In the Grafana dashboards, it is usually visualized as a
  rate per second, averaged with a sliding window of a minute.

  This metrics reflects the performance of an instance in a certain way.
  Note that your mileage may vary according to available resources as well
  as to complexity of the requests the client sends.
