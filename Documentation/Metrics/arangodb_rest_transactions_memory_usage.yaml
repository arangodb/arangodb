  Global value of accumulated memory consumption for REST transactions.
unit: bytes
type: gauge
category: RocksDB
complexity: advanced
exposedBy:
  - dbserver
  - coordinator
  - agent

description: |
  This metric reflects the current amount of memory in bytes consumed by 
  user-originated transactions in arangod. These are either streaming
  transactions, JavaScript transactions, or document operations outside
  of a transaction. Top-level AQL queries are excluded here, as they have
  their own metric (arangodb_aql_global_memory_usage).
