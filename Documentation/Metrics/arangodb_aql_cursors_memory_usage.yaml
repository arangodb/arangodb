  Total memory usage of active AQL query result cursors.
  This metric contains the memory usage of query result cursors that
  are created when a non-stream AQL query has finished and stores its
  result on the server for the client application to consume in batches.
  
  When an AQL query has finished building up its result, the initial batch
  of the result will be sent back to the client application. If the entire
  query result fits into a single batch, no cursor will be created and the
  query result will be returned to the client.
  If the query result is larger than a single batch, a server-side cursor
  is created, from which the client application can incrementally fetch
  more data. While that server-side cursor is present, its memory usage
  is counted in this metric.
  
  While an AQL query is executing and is building up its result, the memory 
  usage of the query is included in the running query's `memoryUsage`
  attribute and in the metric `arangodb_aql_global_memory_usage`.

  The memory usage of stream AQL queries is not included in this metric,
  because a stream AQL query does not build up its entire result first
  and then creates a cursor, but it will start executing and create a 
  cursor already after building the first batch of results. The query
  will remain active until the entire result is consumed or the query gets
  aborted. While the query is active, its memory usage is included in its
  `memoryUsage` attribute and in the metric `arangodb_aql_global_memory_usage`.
