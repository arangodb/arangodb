description: |
  This metric reflects the current number of active hash tables used by the
  in-memory cache which sits in front of RocksDB. Active tables are used for
  caching index entries. There should be one active table per index per shard
  for each index that has in-memory caching enabled. There can also be
  additional active tables while an existing hash table is migrated to a
  larger table.
