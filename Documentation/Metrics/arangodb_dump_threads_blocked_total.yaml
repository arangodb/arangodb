introducedIn: "3.12.0"
help: |
  Number of times a server-side dump thread was blocked
  because it honored the server-side memory limit for dumps.

description: |
  This metric will be increased whenever a server-side dump
  thread tries to prefetch more data from the database and
  make it ready to use for fetching, but doing so would
  violated the configured per-server memory limit for all
  ongoing arangodump invocations.
troubleshoot: |
  If this metric keeps increasing drastically, it is an
  indication that the server could buffer and provide dump
  responses faster than it is allowed to. The two ways of
  fixing this problem are to increase the amount of memory
  that dumps can use, by increasing the value of the startup
  option `--dump.max-memory-usage`, to reduce the number
  of parallel threads used in an arangodump invocation, or
  to start less concurrent arangodumps.
  
  This metric will have a value of 0 on coordinators. It will
  also not be increased for arangodump invocations that did
  not use `--parallel-dump` option.
