description: |
  Number of requests forwarded to another coordinator.
  Request forwarding can happen in load-balanced setups,
  when one coordinator receives and forwards requests 
  that can only be handled by a different coordinator.
  This includes requests for streaming transactions,
  AQL, query cursors, Pregel jobs and some others.
