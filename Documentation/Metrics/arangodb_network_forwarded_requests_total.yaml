description: |
  Number of requests forwarded to another Coordinator.
  Request forwarding can happen in load-balanced setups,
  when one Coordinator receives and forwards requests
  that can only be handled by a different Coordinator.
  This includes requests for streaming transactions,
  AQL, query cursors, Pregel jobs and some others.
