  The total number of queue jobs done.
  Calculating the difference between `arangodb_scheduler_jobs_dequeued` and
  `arangodb_scheduler_jobs_done` gives the total number of jobs currently being
  processed.
  
  In V2 this metric was changed to a counter and renamed to
  `arangodb_scheduler_jobs_done_total`.
