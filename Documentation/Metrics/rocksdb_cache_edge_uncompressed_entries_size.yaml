description: |
  Total gross memory size of all edge cache data that were ever stored in
  the edge cache of any collection/shard. The size is calculated before any
  potential compression.
  Note that this metric is incremented upon every cache insert attempt. 
  It is increased also when data cannot be inserted into the cache (e.g. because
  the cache had no memory left). The metric is not decreased when data gets 
  evicted from the cache.
