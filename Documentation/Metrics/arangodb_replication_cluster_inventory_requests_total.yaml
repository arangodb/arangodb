description: |
  When using a DC-2-DC configuration of ArangoDB this metric is active on both data-centers.
  It indicates that the follower data-center periodically matches the available databases and collections
  in order to mirror them. If no DC-2-DC is set up this value is expected to be 0.
troubleshoot: |
  If you have a DC-2-DC installation, and this metric stays constant over a longer period of time in any of the two data centers
  this indicates that the follower data center is not properly connected anymore.
  The issue most likely is within the sync process on either of the two data-centers as they do not compare their inventory anymore.
  This gives no information about the healthiness of the ArangoDB cluster itself, please check other metrics for this.
