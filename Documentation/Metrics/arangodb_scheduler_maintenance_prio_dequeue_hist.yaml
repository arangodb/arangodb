description: |
  This histogram provides the distribution of time required to take entries
  from the maintenance priority queue, i.e., the amount of time the jobs were
  sitting in the queue. Long dequeue times indicate that the server is under
  heavy load and maintenance jobs cannot be dequeued in a timely manner.
  Note that maintenance jobs are critical for the operation of the cluster, so
  it is important to keep these dequeue times low.
