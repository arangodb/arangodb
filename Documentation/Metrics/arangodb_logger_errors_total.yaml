description: |
  Total number of errors (ERR messages) logged by the logger. 

  If a problem is encountered which is fatal to some operation, but not for
  the service or the application as a whole, then an _error is logged.

  Reasons for log entries of this severity are for example include missing
  data, inability to open required files, incorrect connection strings,
  missing services.

  If an error is logged then it should be taken seriously as it may require 
  user intervention to solve.
