description: |
  On Windows, this figure contains the total number of page faults.
  On other system, this figure contains the number of major faults the
  process has made which have required loading a memory page from disk.
troubleshooting: |
  If the rate of this is high, i.e. it increases fast, it could be an indication
  that the memory usage is too high, or the memory is too low, or paging is done
  too aggressively (for Linux, this see sysctl and vm.swappiness).
