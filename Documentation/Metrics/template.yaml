name: arangodb_metric
introducedIn: "3.10.2" # The version the feature is added to the current branch's version.
# For example, if a metric is added to v3.9.6, v3.10.2, and devel, then introducedIn
# should be set to "3.9.6" in the 3.9 branch, "3.10.2" in the 3.10 branch, and
# also "3.10.2" in devel, implying that the metric is available in all versions
# after v3.10.2 (v3.10.3, v3.10.4, etc. as well as 3.11.0 and later).
