description: |
  Number of intermediate commits performed in transactions.
  An intermediate commit happens if a logical transaction needs to be
  split into multiple physical transaction because of the volume of data
  handled in the transaction. The thresholds for when to perform an
  intermediate commit can be controlled by startup options 
  `--rocksdb.intermediate-commit-count` (number of write operations after
  which an intermediate commit is triggered) and `--rocksdb.intermediate-commit-size`
  (cumulated size of write operations after which an intermediate commit is triggered).
  The values can also be overridden for individual transactions.
  This metric was named `arangodb_intermediate_commits` in previous
  versions of ArangoDb.

  If this value is non-zero, it doesn't necessarily indicate a problem. It can
  happen for large transactions and large data-loading jobs. However, as modifications
  performed by intermediate commits are persisted and cannot simply be rolled back in 
  memory, it should be monitored whether the intermediate commits only happen for
  operations where they are expected. If they also happen for operations that are
  supposed to be atomic, then the intermediate commit size and count parameters need
  to be adjusted, or larger operations should be broken up into smaller ones in the
  client application.
