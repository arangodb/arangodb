description: |
  Number of times a mismatching shard checksum was detected when
  syncing shards. This is a very special metric which is rarely used.
  When followers of shards get in sync with their leaders, just when
  everything is completed a final checksum is taken as an additional
  precaution. If this checksum differs between leader an follower, the
  incremental resync process starts from scratch.

  Normally, this number is always `0`. If it is not, then usually
  something is wrong, please contact ArangoDB customer support in this
  case.
