description: |
  Number of times a mismatching shard checksum was detected when
  syncing shards. This is a very special metric which is rarely used.
  When followers of shards get in sync with their leaders, just when
  everything is completed a final checksum is taken as an additional
  precaution. If this checksum differs between leader an follower, the
  resync process starts from scratch.

  Normally, this number will always be 0. If it is not, then usually
  something is wrong, please contact ArangoDB customer support in this
  case.
