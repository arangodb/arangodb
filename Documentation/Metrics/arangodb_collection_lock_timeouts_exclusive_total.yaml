description: |
  Number of timeouts when trying to acquire collection exclusive locks.
  This counter will be increased whenever an exclusive collection lock
  cannot be acquired within the configured lock timeout.
troubleshoot: |
  In case this value is considered too high, check if there are AQL queries
  or transactions that use exclusive locks on collections, and try to reduce them. 
  Operations using exclusive locks may lock out other queries/transactions temporarily, 
  which can lead to other operations running into timeouts waiting for the same locks.
