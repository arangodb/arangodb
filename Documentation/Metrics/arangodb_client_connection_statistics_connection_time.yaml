description: |
  Histogram of the connection's total lifetime, i.e., the time between the
  point when the connection was established until it was closed. Smaller
  numbers indicate that there is not a lot of load and/or that connections
  are not reused for multiple requests. Consider using keep-alive header
  or HTTP/2.
