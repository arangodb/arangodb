description: |
  Total memory usage of request statistics. 
  If the startup option `--server.statistics` is set to `true`, then some
  request statistics are built up in memory for incoming requests.
  Some memory is pre-allocated at startup for higher efficiency.
  It is expected that the memory usage reported by this metric remains
  relatively constant over time. It should grow only when there are bursts of 
  incoming requests.
  No memory will be allocated for request statistics if the startup option
  is set to `false`.
