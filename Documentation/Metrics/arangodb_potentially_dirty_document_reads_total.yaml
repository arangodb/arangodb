description: |
  This counter exposes the number of document reads (single or batch to
  shards in the cluster) which have been executed with "dirty reads".
  A dirty read is one which may also use follower shards and not only
  leader shards. Note that it is the transaction in the context of which
  the read runs which determines, if dirty reads are allowed.
