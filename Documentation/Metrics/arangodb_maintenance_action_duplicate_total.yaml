description: |
  Database servers execute reconciliation actions to let the cluster converge
  to the desired state. Actions are created, registered, queued and executed.
  Once they are done they will eventually be removed.

  This metric counts the number of actions that have been created but found to
  be a duplicate of a already queued action.
