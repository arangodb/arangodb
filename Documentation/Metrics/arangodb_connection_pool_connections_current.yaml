  Current number of connections in pool. There are two pools, one for the
  agency communication with label `AgencyComm` and one for the other
  cluster internal communication with label `ClusterComm`.

  Normally, one should not see an excessive amount of open connections
  here, unless a very high amount of operations happens concurrently.
