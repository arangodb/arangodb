description: |
  Size of the agency's in-memory part of replicated log in bytes.
  The replicated log will grow in memory until a certain number of
  log entries have been accumulated. Then the in-memory log will
  be compacted. The number of in-memory log entries to keep before
  log compaction kicks in can be controlled via the startup option
  ` --agency.compaction-keep-size`.
