description: |
  Size of the Agency's in-memory part of replicated log in bytes.
  The replicated log grows in memory until a certain number of
  log entries have been accumulated. Then the in-memory log is
  compacted. The number of in-memory log entries to keep before
  log compaction kicks in can be controlled via the startup option
  `--agency.compaction-keep-size`.
