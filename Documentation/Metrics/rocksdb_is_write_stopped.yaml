  This metric exhibits the RocksDB metric `rocksdb-is-write-stopped`.
  It shows `1` if writing to RocksDB has been stopped, and otherwise 0.
  If `1` is shown, this usually means that there are too many uncompacted
  files and the RocksDB background threads have not managed to keep up
  with their compaction work. This situation should be avoided, since
  nasty delays in database operations are incurred. If in doubt,
  contact ArangoDB support.
