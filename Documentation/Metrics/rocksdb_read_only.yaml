  RocksDB metric "background-errors".
unit: number
type: gauge
category: RocksDB
complexity: simple
exposedBy:
  - dbserver
  - agent

description: |
  This metric indicates whether RocksDB currently is in read-only
  mode, due to a background error. If RocksDB is in read-only mode,
  this metric will have a value of "1". When in read-only mode, all
  writes into RocksDB will fail. When RocksDB is in normal operations
  mode, this metric will have a value of "0".

  If this value is non-zero, it means that all write operations in
  RocksDB will fail until the RocksDB background error is resolved.
  The arangod server logfile should show more details about the exact
  errors that are happening, so logs should be inspected first.
  RocksDB can set a background error when some I/O operation fails. 
  This is often due to disk space usage issues, so often either freeing 
  disk space or increasing the disk capacity will help.
  Under some conditions, RocksDB can automatically resume from the 
  background error and go back into normal operations. However, if the
  background error happens during certain RocksDB operations, it cannot
  resume operations automatically, so the instance will need a manual
  restart after the error condition is removed.
