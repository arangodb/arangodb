  Accumulated time needed to apply replication tailing data.

description: |
  The accumulated time needed to locally process the continuous
  replication log on a follower received from a replication
  leader.
throubleshoot: |
  If you see unusual spikes here, the follower might not have enough
  IO bandwith or might be overloaded. Try to provision more IOPS or
  more CPU capacity. Additionally, it could make sense to compare the
  value with all other available follower dbservers to detect potential
  differences.
