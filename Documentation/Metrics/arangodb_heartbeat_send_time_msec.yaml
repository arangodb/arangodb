  Time required to send a heartbeat.

description: |
  Histogram of times required to send heartbeats. For every heartbeat
  sent the time is measured and an event is put into the histogram.
  In the single server, this counter is only used in active failover mode.
threshold: |
  It is a bad sign for health if heartbeat transmissions are not fast. 
  If there are heartbeats which frequently take longer than a few hundred
  milliseconds, or even seconds, this can eventually lead to failover actions 
  which are ultimately bad for the service.
troubleshoot: |
  High heartbeat send times can be a sign of overload or of bad network 
  connectivity. Potentially move the agent instances to separate machines.
