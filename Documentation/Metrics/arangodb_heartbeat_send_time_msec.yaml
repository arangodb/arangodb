  Time required to send a heartbeat.
unit: ms
type: histogram
category: Health
complexity: medium

description: |
  Histogram of times required to send heartbeats. For every heartbeat
  sent the time is measured and an event is put into the histogram.
threshold: |
  It is a bad sign for health if heartbeat transmissions are not fast.
  If there are heartbeats which frequently take longer than a few hundred
  milliseconds, or even seconds, this can eventually lead to failover actions
  which are ultimately bad for the service.
troubleshoot: |
  High heartbeat send times can be a sign of overload or of bad network
  connectivity. Potentially move the Agent instances to separate machines.
