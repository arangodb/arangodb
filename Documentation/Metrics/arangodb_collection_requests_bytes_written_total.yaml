  This metric exposes the per-shard number of bytes written by write operation
  requests on DB-Servers, on both leaders and followers.
  It is increased by AQL queries and single-/multi-document write operations.
  The metric is first increased only the leader, but for every replication request
  to followers it is also increased on followers.
  
  For every write operation, the metric is increased by the approximate
  number of bytes written for the document or edge in question.
  If an operation writes multiple documents/edges, it increases the counter
  multiple times, each time with the approximate number of bytes written for the
  particular document/edge.

  An AQL query also increases the counter for every document or edge written,
  each time with the approximate number of bytes written for document/edge.
  
  The numbers reported by this metric normally relate to the cumulated sizes of
  documents/edges written. For remove operations, however, only a fixed number of
  bytes is counted per removed document/edge. For truncate operations, the metrics
  will be affected differently depending on how the truncate is executed internally.
  For truncates on smaller shards, the truncate operation will be executed as the
  removal of the individual documents in the shard. Thus the metric will also be
  increased as if the documents were removed individually. Truncate operations on
  larger shards however will be executed via a special operation in the storage
  engine, which marks a whole range of documents as removed, but defers the actual
  removal until much later (compaction process). If a truncate is executed like
  this, the metric will not be increased at all.
  Writes into secondary indexes are not counted at all.
  The metric is also increased for transactions that are started but later aborted.

  This metric is not exposed by default. It is only present if the startup option
  `--server.export-shard-usage-metrics` is set to either `enabled-per-shard` or 
  `enabled-per-shard-per-user`. With the former setting, the metric has different 
  labels for each shard that was read from. With the latter setting, the metric 
  has different labels for each combination of shard and user that accessed the shard.
  The metric is only exposed on DB servers and not on Coordinators or single servers.
  
  Note that internal operations, such as internal queries executed for statistics
  gathering, internal garbage collection, and TTL index cleanup are not counted in
  these metrics. Additionally, all requests that use the superuser JWT for
  authentication and that do not have a specific user set, are not counted.
  Requests are also only counted if they have an ArangoDB user associated with them,
  so that the cluster must also be running with authentication turned on.
