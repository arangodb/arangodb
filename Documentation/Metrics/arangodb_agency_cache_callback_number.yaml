  This reflects the current number of callbacks the local `AgencyCache`
  has registered.
  This metric was named `arangodb_agency_cache_callback_count` in
  previous versions of ArangoDB.
  Note that on single servers this metric only has a non-zero value
  in the Active Failover deployment mode.
threshold: |
  This number is usually very low, something like `2` or `3`.

  If this number is considerably higher, this should be investigated.
