description: |
  This metric reflects the recent hit rate of the ArangoDB in-memory
  cache which is sitting in front of RocksDB. For example, the edge
  cache is a part of this. The value is a ratio between `0` and `1`.
  If the hit rate is too low, you might have to little RAM available
  for the in-memory caches.
