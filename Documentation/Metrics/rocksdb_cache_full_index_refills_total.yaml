description: |
  This metric shows the total number of refill operations to in-memory
  edge caches for entire edge indexes. On DB-Servers, a full index reload can
  increase this metric by more than one, as counting is done per shard.
  On Coordinators and Agents, this metric always contains a value of zero.
