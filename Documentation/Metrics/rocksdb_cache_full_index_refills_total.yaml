description: |
  This metric shows the total number of refill operations to in-memory
  index caches for entire edge indexes and cache-enabled persistent indexes.
  On DB-Servers, a full index reload can increase this metric by more than one,
  as counting is done per shard.
  On Coordinators and Agents, this metric always contains a value of zero.
