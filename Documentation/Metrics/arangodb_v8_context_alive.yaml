description: |
  Number of V8 contexts currently alive. Normally, only coordinators and
  single servers should have V8 contexts, for dbservers and agents the
  value is always zero.
threshold: |
  If this number is close to the maximum allowed number of V8 contexts,
  there might be a shortage. This can delay Foxx queries and AQL
  user defined functions. On the other hand, V8 contexts can use
  quite a lot of memory, so one should not have too many if RAM
  is scarce.
