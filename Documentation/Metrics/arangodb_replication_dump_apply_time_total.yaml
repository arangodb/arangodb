  Accumulated time needed to apply asynchronously replicated data on initial synchronization of shards.
unit: ms
type: counter

description: |
  Measures the time required to clone the existing leader copy of the data onto a new replica shard.
  Will only be measured on the follower server. This time is expected to increase whenever new followers
  are created, e.g. increasing replication factor, shard redistribution.
troubleshoot: |
  This metric measures as typical operation to keep the cluster resilient, so no reaction is required.
  In a stable cluster situation (no outages, no collection modification) this metric should also be stable.
