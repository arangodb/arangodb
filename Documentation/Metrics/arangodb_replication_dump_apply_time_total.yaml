  Accumulated time needed to apply asynchronously replicated data on initial synchronization of shards.

description: |
  Measures the time required to clone the existing leader copy of the data onto a new replica shard.
  It is only measured on the follower server. This time is expected to increase whenever new followers
  are created, e.g. increasing replication factor, shard redistribution.

  This metric measures as typical operation to keep the cluster resilient, so no reaction is required.
  In a stable cluster situation (no outages, no collection modification) this metric should also be stable.
