description: |
  Number of arangosearch links and inverted indexes that are
  currently out of sync. A link or inverted index is out of sync
  if the recovery for it is intentionally skipped or a commit
  operation on the link/index has failed.
troubleshoot: |
  If this metric contains a value greater than zero, the
  log files should be checked to find out which links/indexes
  are affected. The out-of-sync links/indexes should then
  be dropped and recreated.
