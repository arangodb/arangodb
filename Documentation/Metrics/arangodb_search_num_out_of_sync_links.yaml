description: |
  Number of arangosearch links that are currently out of sync. 
  A link is out of sync if the recovery for it is intentionally 
  skipped or a commit operation on the link has failed.
troubleshoot: |
  If this metric contains a value greater than zero, the
  log files should be checked to find out which links
  are affected. The out-of-sync links should then be dropped 
  and recreated.
