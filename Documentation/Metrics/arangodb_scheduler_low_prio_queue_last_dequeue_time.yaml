  Last recorded dequeue time for a low priority queue item, i.e., the amount of
  time the job was sitting in the queue. If there is nothing to do for a long
  time, this metric will be reset to zero.
  A large value for this metric indicates that the server is under heavy load
  and low priority jobs cannot be dequeued in a timely manner.
