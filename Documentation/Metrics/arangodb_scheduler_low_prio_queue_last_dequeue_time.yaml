description: |
  Last recorded dequeue time for a low priority queue item, i.e., the amount of
  time the job was sitting in the queue. If there is nothing to do for a long
  time, this metric will be reset to zero.
  A large value for this metric indicates that the server is under heavy load
  and low priority jobs cannot be dequeued in a timely manner
threshold: Normally this time should be clearly sub-second.
troubleshoot: If you see larger values here, in particular over a longer period
  of time, you should consider reducing the load of the server (if possible),
  scaling up (bigger machine) or scaling out (more coordinators). Otherwise
  requests cannot be processed in a timely manner and you run the risk that the
  queue becomes full and requests are declined.
