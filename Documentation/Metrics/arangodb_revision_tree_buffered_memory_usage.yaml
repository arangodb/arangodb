description: |
  Total memory usage of buffered updates for all revision trees of
  collections/shards.
  When data in a collection/shard is modified, the changes to the
  revision trees are first buffered in memory and applied later after
  the operation commits.
  Buffered changes are applied to the revision trees in large chunks.
  Whenever the buffered changes are applied, memory is freed again
  and this metric should go down.
troubleshoot: |
  If this metric keeps increasing, it is a sign that the instance
  cannot catch up with the write load.
