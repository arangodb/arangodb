description: |
  Number of file descriptors currently opened by the arangod process. 
  This will include regular files as well as sockets.
  The metric is only available on platforms that support it.
  As counting the number of file descriptors can be expensive and can have
  an impact on performance, the metric will only be updated in a controllable
  interval. The interval can be adjusted via the startup option 
  `--server.count-descriptors-interval`. Shorter intervals mean more up-to-date
  count values, at the potential expense of more IO operations that are
  required for counting.
  It is possible to turn off counting of file descriptors by setting the
  interval to 0. In this case, the metric will report a value of 0.
