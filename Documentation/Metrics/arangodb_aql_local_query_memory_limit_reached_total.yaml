description: |
  Total number of times a local query memory limit threshold was reached, i.e.
  a single query tried to allocate more memory than configured in the query's
  `memoryLimit` attribute or the value configured via the startup option
  `--query.memory-limit`.
  Every time this counter increases, an AQL query aborted with a
  "resource limit exceeded" error.
