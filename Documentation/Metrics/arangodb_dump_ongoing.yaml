description: |
  This metric shows the number of currently ongoing parallel 
  arangodump operations that are ongoing on the server. It will
  be increased whenever arangodump is invoked with the `--parallel-dump`
  option and the server hosts at least one collection/shard that is
  part of the dump.
  The value will be decreased whenever a parallel arangodump operation
  finishes, or if it is abandoned, after the timeout value used for
  the server-side part of the dump operation.
  
  This metric will have a value of 0 on Coordinators. The metric will
  not be increased for any arangodump invocations that did not use the
  `--parallel-dump` option.
