description: |
  Number of Arangosearch parallel execution threads requested by queries.
troubleshoot: |
  If this metric contains a value lower than configured "--arangosearch.execution-threads-limit" 
  (number of cores * 2 by default) then there is enought threads for runninng queries with parallel execution.
  Value of metric represents number of currently used threads. If the value is greater than
  "--arangosearch.execution-threads-limit" that means currently some queries can not get enough threads to 
  achieve requested parallelism. In that state queries are less parallel up to single-threaded execution. 
  Query performance migth degrade.
