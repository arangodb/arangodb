  Number of ArangoSearch parallel execution threads requested by queries.

description: |
    The value of this metric represents the number of currently used execution
    threads for `SEARCH` operations against Views.
troubleshoot: |
  If this metric contains a value lower than the configured
  `--arangosearch.execution-threads-limit` (number of cores * 2 by default)
  then there are enough threads for running queries with parallel execution.

  If the value is greater than the limit, some queries can not get enough threads
  to achieve the requested parallelism currently. In this state, queries are
  less parallel up to single-threaded execution. Query performance might degrade.
