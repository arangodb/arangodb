  Number of ArangoSearch parallel execution threads requested by queries.

description: |
  This metric tracks the desired parallelism for `SEARCH` operations against
  Views. If the value is below the configured thread limit
  (`--arangosearch.execution-threads-limit` startup option), it coincides with
  the number of currently active threads.
troubleshoot: |
  If this metric contains a value lower than the configured
  `--arangosearch.execution-threads-limit` (number of cores * 2 by default)
  then there are enough threads for running queries with parallel execution.

  If the value is greater than the limit, some queries can not get enough threads
  to achieve the requested parallelism currently. In this state, queries are
  less parallel up to single-threaded execution. Query performance might degrade.
