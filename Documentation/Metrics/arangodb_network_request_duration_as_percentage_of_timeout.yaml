description: |
  Histogram providing the round-trip time of internal requests as a percentage
  of the respective request timeout.
  This metric provides values between `0` and `100`.
troubleshoot: |
  High values indicate problems with requests that have timed out or have not been
  far away from running into timeouts. If many requests timeout, this is normally
  a symptom of overload. This can normally be mitigated by reducing the workload
  or adjusting the type of operations that are causing the high response times.
  If the timeouts happen as a result of not enough processing power, it may be
  useful to scale up the cluster.
