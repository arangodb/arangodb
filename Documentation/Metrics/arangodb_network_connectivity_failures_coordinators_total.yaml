description: |
  Number of failed connectivity check requests sent by this instance
  to Coordinators.
  The metric will be increased if a cluster-internal connection to a
  Coordinator cannot be established within 10 seconds. In this case the
  instance will also log a warning.
  Connectivity checks run with a configurable frequency, adjustable via
  the `--cluster.connectivity-check-interval` startup option.

troubleshoot: |
  If this metric keeps increasing permanently or for longer periods, there
  are likely network connectivity issues or misconfigurations, which can
  prevent the instance from connecting to every Coordinator in the cluster
  (potentially connecting to itself). In this case it is advised to check
  the connectivity manually, and ensure that the instance can make connections
  to all Coordinators, potentially including itself.

  If there are temporary network glitches or instance restarts, this metric
  can also increase. But increases should stop once the network has stabilized
  and/or instances have restarted successfully.
