  The total number of jobs dequeued from all scheduler queues.
  Calculating the difference between `arangodb_scheduler_jobs_submitted` and
  `arangodb_scheduler_jobs_dequeued` gives the total number of currently queued
  jobs.
  Calculating the difference between `arangodb_scheduler_jobs_dequeued` and
  `arangodb_scheduler_jobs_done` gives the number of jobs currently being
