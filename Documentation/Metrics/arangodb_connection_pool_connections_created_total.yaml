description: |
  Total number of connections created for connection pool. There are
  two pools, one for the Agency communication with label `AgencyComm`
  and one for the other cluster internal communication with label
  `ClusterComm`.
threshold: |
  Because of idle timeouts, the total number of connections ever created
  grows. However, under high load, most connections should usually
  be reused and a fast growth of this number can indicate underlying
  connectivity issues.
