description: |
  Total effective memory size of all edge cache data that were stored in the
  the edge cache of any collection/shard since the server start. 
  The size is calculated after any potential compression, so the compression 
  efficiency can be estimated by this metric by the size of the uncompressed 
  edge cache entries.
  Note that this metric is incremented upon every edge cache insert attempt.
  It is increased also when data cannot be inserted into the cache (e.g. because
  the cache had no memory left). The metric is not decreased when data gets 
  evicted from the cache.
