description: |
  Total number of 'free memory' tasks that were scheduled by the
  in-memory edge cache subsystem. This metric will be increased
  whenever the cache subsystem schedules a task to free up memory
  in one of the managed in-memory caches. It is expected to see
  this metric rising when the cache subsystem hits its global
  memory budget.
