description: |
  The revision trees of collections/shards are normally present
  in RAM in an uncompressed state. However, to reduce the memory
  usage of keeping all revision trees in RAM at the same time, 
  revision trees can be put into "hibernation" mode. Any inactive
  revision tree will automatically be hibernated by ArangoDB after
  a while. For the hibernation step, a revision tree will be 
  compressed in RAM, and only the compressed version is then kept.
  Later accesses of a compressed revision tree require uncompressing
  the tree again. 
  This metric is increased whenever a revision tree is restored from
  its hibernated state back into an uncompressed form in RAM.
  This can happened many times during the lifetime of a revision tree.
