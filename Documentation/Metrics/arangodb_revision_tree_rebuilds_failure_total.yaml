  Number of failed background revision tree rebuilds.
  Ideally this value stays at 0, because if a revision tree rebuild
  fails, the system may stall and not be able to make progress in
  terms of WAL file collection. In case the counter is increased,
  an error message will also be logged to the arangod logfile.
