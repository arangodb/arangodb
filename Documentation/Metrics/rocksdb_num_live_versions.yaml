  This metric exhibits the RocksDB metric "rocksdb-num-live-versions".
  It shows the number of live versions. `Version` is an internal data
  structure. See `version_set.h` in the RocksDB source for details. More
  live versions often mean more SST files are held from being deleted,
  by iterators or unfinished compactions. This number is the number
  summed up over all column families.
