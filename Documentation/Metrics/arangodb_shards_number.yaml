description: |
  Number of shards on this machine. Every shard has a leader and
  potentially multiple followers. This metric counts both leader and
  follower shards.
troubleshoot: |
  Since both leader and follower shards use memory and disk space,
  the total number of shards should be approximately balanced
  evenly across the dbservers. To achieve this, you can either
  move shards manually, use the "Rebalance shards" button in the
  UI, or use the cluster maintenance tools in [this repository]
  (https://github.com/arangodb/cluster-maintenance) (`create-move-plan`
  and `execute-move-plan` specifically). In the latter case, contact
  ArangoDB customer support.
