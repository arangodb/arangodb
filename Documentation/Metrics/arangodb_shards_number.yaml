description: |
  Number of shards on this machine. Every shard has a leader and
  potentially multiple followers. This metric counts both leader and
  follower shards.
troubleshoot: |
  Since both leader and follower shards use memory and disk space,
  the total number of shards should be approximately balanced
  evenly across the DB-Servers. To achieve this, you can either
  move shards manually, use the **Rebalance shards** button in the
  ArangoDB web interface, or use the
  [cluster maintenance tools](https://github.com/arangodb/cluster-maintenance)
  (`create-move-plan` and `execute-move-plan` specifically). In the latter
  case, contact ArangoDB customer support.
