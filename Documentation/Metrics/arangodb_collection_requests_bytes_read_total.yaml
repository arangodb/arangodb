description: |
  This metric exposes the per-shard number of bytes read by read operation
  requests on DB-Servers.
  It is increased by AQL queries that read documents or edges and for single-
  or multi-document read operations.
  The metric is normally increased only on the leader, but it can also increase
  on followers if "reads from followers" are enabled.

  For every read operation, the metric is increased by the approximate
  number of bytes read to retrieve the underlying document or edge data. This
  is also true if a document or edge is served from an in-memory cache.
  If an operation reads multiple documents/edges, it increases the counter
  multiple times, each time with the approximate number of bytes read for the
  particular document/edge.
  
  The numbers reported by this metric normally relate to the cumulated sizes of
  documents/edges read.
  The metric is also increased for transactions that are started but later
  aborted. However, metrics updates may be buffered until the end of a transaction.
  Note that the metric is not increased for secondary index point lookups or
  scans, or for scans in a collection that iterate over documents but do not
  read them.
  
  This metric is not exposed by default. It is only present if the startup option
  `--server.export-shard-usage-metrics` is set to either `enabled-per-shard` or 
  `enabled-per-shard-per-user`. With the former setting, the metric has different 
  labels for each shard that was read from. With the latter setting, the metric 
  has different labels for each combination of shard and user that accessed the shard.
  The metric is only exposed on DB servers and not on Coordinators or single servers.
  
  Note that internal operations, such as internal queries executed for statistics
  gathering, internal garbage collection, and TTL index cleanup are not counted in
  these metrics. Additionally, all requests that use the superuser JWT for
  authentication and that do not have a specific user set, are not counted.
  Requests are also only counted if they have an ArangoDB user associated with them,
  so that the cluster must also be running with authentication turned on.

  Enabling this metric via the startup option will likely result in a small
  latency overhead of few percent for read operations. The exact overhead depends on
  several factors, such as the type of operation (single or multi-document operation),
  replication factor, network latency etc.
