  Total memory usage of user transactions (excluding top-level AQL queries).

description: |
  This metric reflects the current amount of memory in bytes consumed by 
  user-originated transactions in arangod. These are either streaming
  transactions, JavaScript transactions, or single-document/multi-document
  operations outside of a transaction. The metric includes the memory used
  for index creation operations. Top-level AQL queries are excluded from it,
  as they have their own metric (`arangodb_aql_global_memory_usage`).
