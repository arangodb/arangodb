description: |
  Total memory usage of currently ongoing internal transactions, i.e.
  transactions that were not explicitly started by an end user.
  Internal transactions include ArangoDB-internal maintenance queries,
  queries to purge data from TTL indexes, periodic queries for
  collecting and aggregating statistics, for maintaining the state of
  Foxx, and transactions internally used by shard synchronization.
