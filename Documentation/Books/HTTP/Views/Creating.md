Creating Views
==============

The JSON definition for creating of a view is implementation dependant and
varies for each supported view type. Please refer to the proper section of
the required view type for details.

However, in general the format is the following:

<!-- js/actions/api-view.js -->
@startDocuBlock post_api_view
