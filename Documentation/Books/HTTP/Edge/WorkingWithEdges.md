!CHAPTER Working with Edges using REST 

This is documentation to ArangoDB's
[REST interface for edges](../../Manual/Graphs/Edges/index.html).

Edges are documents with two additional attributes: *_from* and *_to*.
These attributes are mandatory and must contain the document-handle
of the from and to vertices of an edge.

Use the general document
[REST api](../Document/WorkingWithDocuments.md)
for create/read/update/delete.
