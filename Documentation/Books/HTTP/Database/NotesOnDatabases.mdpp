!CHAPTER Notes on Databases

Please keep in mind that each database contains its own system collections,
which need to set up when a database is created. This will make the creation
of a database take a while. Replication is configured on a per-database level,
meaning that any replication logging or applying for the a new database must
be configured explicitly after a new database has been created. Foxx applications
are also available only in the context of the database they have been installed
in. A new database will only provide access to the system applications shipped
with ArangoDB (that is the web interface at the moment) and no other Foxx
applications until they are explicitly installed for the particular database.

!SUBSECTION Database

ArangoDB can handle multiple databases in the same server instance. Databases can be used to logically group and separate data. An ArangoDB database consists of collections and dedicated database-specific worker processes.
A database contains its own collections (which cannot be accessed from other databases), Foxx applications and replication loggers and appliers. Each ArangoDB database contains its own system collections (e.g. _users, _graphs, ...).

There will always be at least one database in ArangoDB. This is the default [database name](../../Manual/Appendix/Glossary.html#database-name)d _system. This database cannot be dropped and provides special operations for creating, dropping and enumerating databases. Users can create additional databases and give them unique names to access them later. Database management operations cannot be initiated from out of user-defined databases.

When ArangoDB is accessed via its HTTP REST API, the database name is read from the first part of the request URI path (e.g. /_db/_system/...). If the request URI does not contain a database name, the database name is automatically determined by the algorithm described in Database-to-Endpoint Mapping .

!SUBSECTION Database Name

A single ArangoDB instance can handle multiple databases in parallel. When multiple databases are used, each database must be given an unique name. This name is used to uniquely identify a database. The default database in ArangoDB is named _system.
The database name is a string consisting of only letters, digits and the _ (underscore) and - (dash) characters. User-defined database names must always start with a letter. Database names are case-sensitive.

!SUBSECTION Database Organization

A single ArangoDB instance can handle multiple databases in parallel. By default, there will be at least one database which is named _system.
Databases are physically stored in separate sub-directories underneath the database directory, which itself resides in the instance's data directory.

Each database has its own sub-directory, named database-<database id>. The database directory contains sub-directories for the collections of the database, and a file named parameter.json. This file contains the database id and name.

In an example ArangoDB instance which has two databases, the filesystem layout could look like this:

```
data/                     # the instance's data directory
  databases/              # sub-directory containing all databases' data
    database-<id>/        # sub-directory for a single database
      parameter.json      # file containing database id and name
      collection-<id>/    # directory containing data about a collection
    database-<id>/        # sub-directory for another database
      parameter.json      # file containing database id and name
      collection-<id>/    # directory containing data about a collection
      collection-<id>/    # directory containing data about a collection
```

Foxx applications are also organized in database-specific directories inside the application path. The filesystem layout could look like this:

```
apps/                   # the instance's application directory
  system/               # system applications (can be ignored)
  databases/            # sub-directory containing database-specific applications
    <database-name>/    # sub-directory for a single database
      <app-name>        # sub-directory for a single application
      <app-name>        # sub-directory for a single application
    <database-name>/    # sub-directory for another database
      <app-name>        # sub-directory for a single application
