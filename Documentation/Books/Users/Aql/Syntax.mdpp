!CHAPTER AQL Syntax

!SUBSECTION Query types

An AQL query must either return a result (indicated by usage of the *RETURN*
keyword) or execute a data-modification operation (indicated by usage
of one of the keywords *INSERT*, *UPDATE*, *REPLACE*, *REMOVE* or *UPSERT*). The AQL
parser will return an error if it detects more than one data-modification 
operation in the same query or if it cannot figure out if the query is meant
to be a data retrieval or a modification operation.

AQL only allows *one* query in a single query string; thus semicolons to
indicate the end of one query and separate multiple queries (as seen in SQL) are
not allowed.

!SUBSECTION Whitespace 

Whitespaces (blanks, carriage returns, line feeds, and tab stops) can be used
in the query text to increase its readability. Tokens have to be separated by
any number of whitespaces. Whitespace within strings or names must be enclosed
in quotes in order to be preserved.

!SUBSECTION Comments 

Comments can be embedded at any position in a query. The text contained in the
comment is ignored by the AQL parser.

Multi-line comments cannot be nested, which means subsequent comment starts within
comments are ignored, comment ends will end the comment.

AQL supports two types of comments:
- Single line comments: These start with a double forward slash and end at
  the end of the line, or the end of the query string (whichever is first).
- Multi line comments: These start with a forward slash and asterisk, and
  end with an asterisk and a following forward slash. They can span as many
  lines as necessary.


    /* this is a comment */ RETURN 1
    /* these */ RETURN /* are */ 1 /* multiple */ + /* comments */ 1
    /* this is
       a multi line
       comment */
    // a single line comment

!SUBSECTION Keywords

On the top level, AQL offers the following operations:
- `FOR`: array iteration
- `RETURN`: results projection
- `FILTER`: results filtering
- `SORT`: result sorting
- `LIMIT`: result slicing
- `LET`: variable assignment
- `COLLECT`: result grouping
- `INSERT`: insertion of new documents
- `UPDATE`: (partial) update of existing documents
- `REPLACE`: replacement of existing documents
- `REMOVE`: removal of existing documents
- `UPSERT`: insertion or update of existing documents

Each of the above operations can be initiated in a query by using a keyword of
the same name. An AQL query can (and typically does) consist of multiple of the
above operations.

An example AQL query may look like this:

    FOR u IN users
      FILTER u.type == "newbie" && u.active == true
      RETURN u.name

In this example query, the terms *FOR*, *FILTER*, and *RETURN* initiate the
higher-level operation according to their name. These terms are also keywords,
meaning that they have a special meaning in the language.

For example, the query parser will use the keywords to find out which high-level
operations to execute. That also means keywords can only be used at certain
locations in a query. This also makes all keywords reserved words that must not
be used for other purposes than they are intended for.

For example, it is not possible to use a keyword as a collection or attribute
name. If a collection or attribute need to have the same name as a keyword, the
collection or attribute name needs to be quoted.

Keywords are case-insensitive, meaning they can be specified in lower, upper, or
mixed case in queries. In this documentation, all keywords are written in upper
case to make them distinguishable from other query parts.

In addition to the higher-level operations keywords, there are other keywords.
The current list of keywords is:

- FOR
- RETURN
- FILTER
- SORT
- LIMIT
- LET
- COLLECT
- INSERT
- UPDATE
- REPLACE
- REMOVE
- UPSERT
- WITH
- ASC
- DESC
- IN
- INTO
- NOT
- AND
- OR
- NULL
- TRUE
- FALSE
- DISTINCT
- GRAPH
- OUTBOUND
- INBOUND
- ANY
- ALL
- NONE
- AGGREGATE

Additional keywords may be added in future versions of ArangoDB. 

!SUBSECTION Names

In general, names are used to identify objects (collections, attributes,
variables, and functions) in AQL queries.

The maximum supported length of any name is 64 bytes. Names in AQL are always
case-sensitive.

Keywords must not be used as names. If a reserved keyword should be used as a
name, the name must be enclosed in backticks or forward ticks. Enclosing a name in 
backticks or forward ticks makes it possible to use otherwise reserved keywords 
as names. An example for this is:

    FOR f IN `filter` 
      RETURN f.`sort`

Due to the backticks, *filter* and *sort* are interpreted as names and not as
keywords here.

The example can alternatively written as:
    
    FOR f IN ´filter´ 
      RETURN f.´sort´


!SUBSUBSECTION Collection names

Collection names can be used in queries as they are. If a collection happens to
have the same name as a keyword, the name must be enclosed in backticks.

Please refer to the [Naming Conventions in ArangoDB](../NamingConventions/CollectionNames.md) about collection naming
conventions.

!SUBSUBSECTION Attribute names

When referring to attributes of documents from a collection, the fully qualified
attribute name must be used. This is because multiple collections with ambiguous
attribute names may be used in a query.  To avoid any ambiguity, it is not
allowed to refer to an unqualified attribute name.

Please refer to the [Naming Conventions in ArangoDB](../NamingConventions/AttributeNames.md) for more information about the
attribute naming conventions.

    FOR u IN users
      FOR f IN friends
        FILTER u.active == true && f.active == true && u.id == f.userId
        RETURN u.name

In the above example, the attribute names *active*, *name*, *id*, and *userId*
are qualified using the collection names they belong to (*u* and *f*
respectively).

!SUBSUBSECTION Variable names

AQL allows the user to assign values to additional variables in a query.  All
variables that are assigned a value must have a name that is unique within the
context of the query. Variable names must be different from the names of any
collection name used in the same query.

    FOR u IN users
      LET friends = u.friends
      RETURN { "name" : u.name, "friends" : friends }

In the above query, *users* is a collection name, and both *u* and *friends* are
variable names. This is because the *FOR* and *LET* operations need target
variables to store their intermediate results.

Allowed characters in variable names are the letters *a* to *z* (both in lower
and upper case), the numbers *0* to *9* and the underscore (*_*) symbol. A
variable name must not start with a number.  If a variable name starts with the
underscore character, it must also contain at least one letter (a-z or A-Z).
