!CHAPTER Foxx API Documentation

In addition to viewing the API documentation of any Foxx app in the admin frontend, you can also mount the API
documentation inside your own Foxx app. This allows you to serve your documentation to users without having to
give them access to the admin frontend or any other parts of ArangoDB.
