Explaining queries
==================

If it is unclear how a given query will perform, clients can retrieve a query's execution plan 
from the AQL query optimizer without actually executing the query. Getting the query execution 
plan from the optimizer is called *explaining*.

An explain will throw an error if the given query is syntactically invalid. Otherwise, it will
return the execution plan and some information about what optimizations could be applied to
the query. The query will not be executed.

Explaining a query can be achieved by calling the [HTTP REST API](../../HTTP/AqlQuery/index.html)
or via _arangosh_.
A query can also be explained from the ArangoShell using the `ArangoDatabase`'s `explain` method
or in detail via `ArangoStatement`'s `explain` method.


### Inspecting query plans

The `explain` method of `ArangoStatement` as shown in the next chapters creates very verbose output.
To get a human-readable output of the query plan you can use the `explain` method on our database
object in arangosh. You may use it like this: (we disable syntax highlighting here)

    @startDocuBlockInline 01_workWithAQL_databaseExplain
    @EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT{01_workWithAQL_databaseExplain}
    db._explain("LET s = SLEEP(0.25) LET t = SLEEP(0.5) RETURN 1", {}, {colors: false});
    @END_EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT
    @endDocuBlock 01_workWithAQL_databaseExplain

The plan contains all execution nodes that are used during a query. These nodes represent different
stages in a query. Each stage gets the input from the stage directly above (its dependencies). 
The plan will show you the estimated number of items (results) for each query stage (under _Est._). Each
query stage roughly equates to a line in your original query, which you can see under _Comment_.


### Profiling queries 

Sometimes when you have a complex query it can be unclear on what time is spent
during the execution, even for intermediate ArangoDB users.

By profiling a query it gets executed with special instrumentation code enabled.
It gives you all the usual information like when explaining a query, but
additionally you get the query profile, [runtime statistics](QueryStatistics.md)
and per-node statistics.

To use this in an interactive fashion on the shell you can use the
`_profileQuery()` method on the `ArangoDatabase` object or use the web interface.

For more information see [Profiling Queries](QueryProfiler.md).

    @startDocuBlockInline 01_workWithAQL_databaseProfileQuery
    @EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT{01_workWithAQL_databaseProfileQuery}
    db._profileQuery("LET s = SLEEP(0.25) LET t = SLEEP(0.5) RETURN 1", {}, {colors: false});
    @END_EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT
    @endDocuBlock 01_workWithAQL_databaseProfileQuery


### Execution plans in detail

By default, the query optimizer will return what it considers to be the *optimal plan*. The
optimal plan will be returned in the `plan` attribute of the result. If `explain` is
called with option `allPlans` set to `true`, all plans will be returned in the `plans`
attribute instead. The result object will also contain an attribute *warnings*, which 
is an array of warnings that occurred during optimization or execution plan creation.

Each plan in the result is an object with the following attributes:
- *nodes*: the array of execution nodes of the plan. [The list of available node types
   can be found here](Optimizer.md)
- *estimatedCost*: the total estimated cost for the plan. If there are multiple
  plans, the optimizer will choose the plan with the lowest total cost.
- *collections*: an array of collections used in the query
- *rules*: an array of rules the optimizer applied. [The list of rules can be 
  found here](Optimizer.md)
- *variables*: array of variables used in the query (note: this may contain
  internal variables created by the optimizer)

Here is an example for retrieving the execution plan of a simple query:

    @startDocuBlockInline 07_workWithAQL_statementsExplain
    @EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT{07_workWithAQL_statementsExplain}
    |var stmt = db._createStatement(
     "FOR user IN _users RETURN user");
    stmt.explain();
    @END_EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT
    @endDocuBlock 07_workWithAQL_statementsExplain

As the output of `explain` is very detailed, it is recommended to use some
scripting to make the output less verbose:

    @startDocuBlockInline 08_workWithAQL_statementsPlans
    @EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT{08_workWithAQL_statementsPlans}
    |var formatPlan = function (plan) {
    |    return { estimatedCost: plan.estimatedCost,
    |        nodes: plan.nodes.map(function(node) {
                return node.type; }) }; };
    formatPlan(stmt.explain().plan);
    @END_EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT
    @endDocuBlock 08_workWithAQL_statementsPlans

If a query contains bind parameters, they must be added to the statement **before**
`explain` is called:

    @startDocuBlockInline 09_workWithAQL_statementsPlansBind
    @EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT{09_workWithAQL_statementsPlansBind}
    |var stmt = db._createStatement(
    | `FOR doc IN @@collection FILTER doc.user == @user RETURN doc`
    );
    stmt.bind({ "@collection" : "_users", "user" : "root" });
    stmt.explain();
    @END_EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT
    @endDocuBlock 09_workWithAQL_statementsPlansBind

In some cases the AQL optimizer creates multiple plans for a single query. By default
only the plan with the lowest total estimated cost is kept, and the other plans are
discarded. To retrieve all plans the optimizer has generated, `explain` can be called
with the option `allPlans` set to `true`.

In the following example, the optimizer has created two plans:

    @startDocuBlockInline 10_workWithAQL_statementsPlansOptimizer0
    @EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT{10_workWithAQL_statementsPlansOptimizer0}
    |var stmt = db._createStatement(
      "FOR user IN _users FILTER user.user == 'root' RETURN user");
    stmt.explain({ allPlans: true }).plans.length;
    @END_EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT
    @endDocuBlock 10_workWithAQL_statementsPlansOptimizer0

To see a slightly more compact version of the plan, the following transformation can be applied:

    @startDocuBlockInline 10_workWithAQL_statementsPlansOptimizer1
    @EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT{10_workWithAQL_statementsPlansOptimizer1}
    ~var stmt = db._createStatement("FOR user IN _users FILTER user.user == 'root' RETURN user");
    |stmt.explain({ allPlans: true }).plans.map(
        function(plan) { return formatPlan(plan); });
    @END_EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT
    @endDocuBlock 10_workWithAQL_statementsPlansOptimizer1

`explain` will also accept the following additional options:
- *maxPlans*: limits the maximum number of plans that are created by the AQL query optimizer
- *optimizer.rules*: an array of to-be-included or to-be-excluded optimizer rules
  can be put into this attribute, telling the optimizer to include or exclude
  specific rules. To disable a rule, prefix its name with a `-`, to enable a rule, prefix it
  with a `+`. There is also a pseudo-rule `all`, which will match all optimizer rules.

The following example disables all optimizer rules but `remove-redundant-calculations`:

    @startDocuBlockInline 10_workWithAQL_statementsPlansOptimizer2
    @EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT{10_workWithAQL_statementsPlansOptimizer2}
    ~var stmt = db._createStatement("FOR user IN _users FILTER user.user == 'root' RETURN user");
    |stmt.explain({ optimizer: {
       rules: [ "-all", "+remove-redundant-calculations" ] } });
    @END_EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT
    @endDocuBlock 10_workWithAQL_statementsPlansOptimizer2


The contents of an execution plan are meant to be machine-readable. To get a human-readable
version of a query's execution plan, the following commands can be used:

    @startDocuBlockInline 10_workWithAQL_statementsPlansOptimizer3
    @EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT{10_workWithAQL_statementsPlansOptimizer3}
    var query = "FOR doc IN mycollection FILTER doc.value > 42 RETURN doc";
    require("@arangodb/aql/explainer").explain(query, {colors:false});
    @END_EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT
    @endDocuBlock 10_workWithAQL_statementsPlansOptimizer3

The above command prints the query's execution plan in the ArangoShell directly, focusing
on the most important information.


### Gathering debug information about a query

If an explain provides no suitable insight into why a query does not perform as
expected, it may be reported to the ArangoDB support. In order to make this as easy
as possible, there is a built-in command in ArangoShell for packaging the query, its
bind parameters and all data required to execute the query elsewhere.

The command will store all data in a file with a configurable filename:

    @startDocuBlockInline 10_workWithAQL_debugging1
    @EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT{10_workWithAQL_debugging1}
    var query = "FOR doc IN mycollection FILTER doc.value > 42 RETURN doc";
    require("@arangodb/aql/explainer").debugDump("/tmp/query-debug-info", query);
    @END_EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT
    @endDocuBlock 10_workWithAQL_debugging1

Entitled users can send the generated file to the ArangoDB support to facilitate 
reproduction and debugging.

If a query contains bind parameters, they will need to specified along with the query
string:
    
    @startDocuBlockInline 10_workWithAQL_debugging2
    @EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT{10_workWithAQL_debugging2}
    var query = "FOR doc IN @@collection FILTER doc.value > @value RETURN doc";
    var bind = { value: 42, "@collection": "mycollection" };
    require("@arangodb/aql/explainer").debugDump("/tmp/query-debug-info", query, bind);
    @END_EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT
    @endDocuBlock 10_workWithAQL_debugging2

It is also possible to include example documents from the underlying collection in
order to make reproduction even easier. Example documents can be sent as they are, or
in an anonymized form. The number of example documents can be specified in the *examples*
options attribute, and should generally be kept low. The *anonymize* option will replace
the contents of string attributes in the examples with "XXX". It will however not 
replace any other types of data (e.g. numeric values) or attribute names. Attribute
names in the examples will always be preserved because they may be indexed and used in
queries:
    
    @startDocuBlockInline 10_workWithAQL_debugging3
    @EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT{10_workWithAQL_debugging3}
    var query = "FOR doc IN @@collection FILTER doc.value > @value RETURN doc";
    var bind = { value: 42, "@collection": "mycollection" };
    var options = { examples: 10, anonymize: true };
    require("@arangodb/aql/explainer").debugDump("/tmp/query-debug-info", query, bind, options);
    @END_EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT
    @endDocuBlock 10_workWithAQL_debugging3
