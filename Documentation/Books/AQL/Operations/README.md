The following high-level operations are described here after:

* [FOR](For.md): Iterate over all elements of an array.
* [RETURN](Return.md): Produce the result of a query.
* [FILTER](Filter.md): Restrict the results to elements that match arbitrary logical conditions.
* [SORT](Sort.md): Force a sort of the array of already produced intermediate results.
* [LIMIT](Limit.md): Reduce the number of elements in the result to at most the specified number, optionally skip elements (pagination).
* [LET](Let.md): Assign an arbitrary value to a variable.
* [COLLECT](Collect.md): Group an array by one or multiple group criteria. Can also count and aggregate.
* [REMOVE](Remove.md): Remove documents from a collection.
* [UPDATE](Update.md): Partially update documents in a collection.
* [REPLACE](Replace.md): Completely replace documents in a collection.
* [INSERT](Insert.md): Insert new documents into a collection.
