Highlights
==========

Version 3.2
-----------

- [**RocksDB Storage Engine**](Architecture/StorageEngines.md): You can now use
  as much data in ArangoDB as you can fit on your disk. Plus, you can enjoy
  performance boosts on writes by having only document-level locks

- [**Pregel**](Graphs/Pregel/README.md):
  We implemented distributed graph processing with Pregel to discover hidden
  patterns, identify communities and perform in-depth analytics of large graph
  data sets.

- [**Fault-Tolerant Foxx**](../HTTP/Foxx/index.html): The Foxx management
  internals have been rewritten from the ground up to make sure
  multi-coordinator cluster setups always keep their services in sync and
  new coordinators are fully initialized even when all existing coordinators
  are unavailable.

- **Enterprise**: Working with some of our largest customers, weâ€™ve added
  further security and scalability features to ArangoDB Enterprise like
  [LDAP integration](Administration/Configuration/Ldap.md),
  [Encryption at Rest](Administration/Encryption/README.md), and the brand new
  [Satellite Collections](Administration/Replication/Synchronous/Satellites.md).

Also see [What's New in 3.2](ReleaseNotes/NewFeatures32.md).

Version 3.1
-----------

- [**SmartGraphs**](Graphs/SmartGraphs/README.md): Scale with graphs to a
  cluster and stay performant. With SmartGraphs you can use the "smartness"
  of your application layer to shard your graph efficiently to your machines
  and let traversals run locally.

- **Encryption Control**: Choose your level of [SSL encryption](Administration/Configuration/SSL.md)

- [**Auditing**](Administration/Auditing/README.md): Keep a detailed log
  of all the important things that happened in ArangoDB.

Also see [What's New in 3.1](ReleaseNotes/NewFeatures31.md).

Version 3.0
-----------

- [**self-organizing cluster**](Scalability/Architecture.md) with
  synchronous replication, master/master setup, shared nothing
  architecture, cluster management agency.

- Deeply integrated, native [**AQL graph traversal**](../AQL/Graphs/index.html)

- [**VelocyPack**](https://github.com/arangodb/velocypack) as new internal
  binary storage format as well as for intermediate AQL values.

- [**Persistent indexes**](Indexing/Persistent.md) via RocksDB suitable
  for sorting and range queries.

- [**Foxx 3.0**](Foxx/README.md): overhauled JS framework for data-centric
  microservices

- Significantly improved [**Web Interface**](Administration/WebInterface/README.md)
