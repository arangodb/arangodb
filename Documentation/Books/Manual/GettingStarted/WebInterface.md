Accessing the Web Interface
===========================

ArangoDB comes with a built-in web interface for administration. The web 
interface can be accessed via the URL:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8529
```

If everything works as expected, you should see the login view:

![Login View](../Administration/WebInterface/images/loginView.png)

For more information on the ArangoDB web interface, see
[Web Interface](../Administration/WebInterface/README.md)
