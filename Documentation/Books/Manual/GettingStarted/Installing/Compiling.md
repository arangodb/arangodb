!CHAPTER Compiling ArangoDB from scratch

The following sections describe how to compile and build the ArangoDB from
scratch. ArangoDB will compile on most Linux and Mac OS X systems. We assume
that you use the GNU C/C++ compiler or clang/clang++ to compile the
source. ArangoDB has been tested with these compilers, but should be able to
compile with any Posix-compliant, C++11-enabled compiler.  Please let us know
whether you successfully compiled it with another C/C++ compiler.

By default, cloning the github repository will checkout **devel**. This version
contains the development version of the ArangoDB.  Use this branch if you want
to make changes to the ArangoDB source.

Please checkout the [cookbook](https://docs.arangodb.com/cookbook) on how to
compile ArangoDB.
