!CHAPTER Installing

First of all, download and install the corresponding RPM or Debian package or use
homebrew on MacOS X. You can find packages for various operation systems at our
[install](https://www.arangodb.com/download) section, including installers
for Windows.

How to do that in detail is described in the subchapters of this section.

On how to set up a cluster, checkout the [Deployment](../../Deployment/README.md)
chapter.
