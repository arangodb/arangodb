Active Failover
===============

This chapter introduces ArangoDB's _Active Failover_ environment.

**Sections:**

- [Active Failover Architecture](architecture-deployment-modes-active-failover-architecture.html)
- [Active Failover Limitations](architecture-deployment-modes-active-failover-limitations.html)

For further information about _Active Failover_ in ArangoDB, please refer to the following
sections included in other chapters of this Manual:

- [Active Failover Deployment](deployment-active-failover.html)
- [Active Failover Administration](administration-active-failover.html)

**Note:** _Asynchronous Failover_, _Resilient Single_, _Active-Passive_ or _Hot
Standby_ are other terms that have been used to define the _Active Failover_ environment. 
Starting from version 3.3 _Active Failover_ is the preferred term to identify such
environment.
