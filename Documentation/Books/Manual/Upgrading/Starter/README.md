Upgrading _Starter_ Deployments
===============================

Starting from versions 3.2.15 and 3.3.8, the ArangoDB [_Starter_](../../Programs/Starter/README.md)
supports a new, automated, procedure to perform upgrades, including rolling upgrades
of a [Cluster](../../Scalability/Cluster/README.md) setup.

The upgrade procedure of the _Starter_ described in this _Section_ can be used to
upgrade to a new hotfix, or to perform an upgrade to a new minor version of ArangoDB.

**Important:** rolling upgrades of Cluster setups from 3.2 to 3.3 are only supported
from versions 3.2.15 and 3.3.9. 

Upgrade Procedure
-----------------

The following procedure has to be executed on every ArangoDB _Starter_ instance.
It is assumed that a _Starter_ deployment with mode `single`, `activefailover` or
`cluster` is running.

### Install the new ArangoDB version binary

Installing the new ArangoDB version binary also includes the latest ArangoDB _Starter_
binary, which is necessary to perform the rolling upgrade.

The first step is to install the new ArangoDB package. 

**Note:** you do not have to stop the _Starter_ processes before upgrading it.

For example, if you want to upgrade to `3.3.8-1` on Debian or Ubuntu, either call

```
$ apt install arangodb=3.3.8
```

(`apt-get` on older versions) if you have added the ArangoDB repository. Or
install a specific package using

```
$ dpkg -i arangodb3-3.3.8-1_amd64.deb
```

after you have downloaded the corresponding file from https://download.arangodb.com/.

#### Stop the Standalone Instance

As the package will automatically start the standalone instance, you might want to
stop it now, as otherwise this standalone instance that is started on your machine
can create some confusion later. As you are using the _Starter_ you do not need
this standalone instance, and you can hence stop it:

```
$ service arangodb3 stop
```

Also, you might want to remove the standalone instance from the default
_runlevels_ to prevent it to start on the next reboot of your machine. How this
is done depends on your distribution and _init_ system. For example, on older Debian
and Ubuntu systems using a SystemV-compatible _init_, you can use:

```
$ update-rc.d -f arangodb3 remove
```

### Stop the _Starter_ without stopping the ArangoDB Server processes

Now all the _Starter_ (_arangodb_) processes have to be stopped.

Please note that **no** _arangod_ processes should be stopped.

In order to stop the _arangodb_ processes, leaving the _arangod_ processes they 
have started up and running (as we want for a rolling upgrade), we will need to
use a command like `kill -9`:

```
kill -9 <pid-of-starter>
```

The _pid_ associated to your _Starter_ can be checked using a command like _ps_:


```
ps -C arangodb -fww
```

The output of the command above does not only show the PID's of all _arangodb_ 
processes but also the used commands, which can be useful for the following
restart of all _arangodb_ processes.

The output belove is from a test machine where three instances of a _Starter_ are
running locally. In a more production-like scenario, you will find only one instance
of _arangodb_ running:

```
ps -C arangodb -fww
UID        PID  PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
max      29419  3684  0 11:46 pts/1    00:00:00 arangodb --starter.data-dir=./db1
max      29504  3695  0 11:46 pts/2    00:00:00 arangodb --starter.data-dir=./db2 --starter.join 127.0.0.1
max      29513  3898  0 11:46 pts/4    00:00:00 arangodb --starter.data-dir=./db3 --starter.join 127.0.0.1
```
    
### Restart the _Starter_

When using a supervisor like _SystemD_, this will happens automatically. In case
the _Starter_ was initiated manually, the _arangodb_ processes have to be restarted
manually with the same command that has been used before.

After you have restarted the _Starter_ you will find yourself in the following
situation:

- The _Starter_ is up and running, and it is on the new version
- The ArangoDB Server processes are up and running, and they are still on the
  old version

### Send an HTTP `POST` request to all _Starters_

A `POST` request with an empty body hast to be sent to `/database-auto-upgrade`
on all _Starters_ one by one. 

Once the upgrade on the first _Starter_ has finished, the same request can be sent
to the next one. 

The default port of the first _Starter_ is 8528. In a local test (all _Starters_
running on the same machine), the ports of the additional _Starters_ are increased
by 5 (before 3.2.15 and 3.3.8) or 10 (since 3.2.15 and 3.3.8).

Please note that the _Starter_ port is also shown in the _Starter_ output e.g.
`Listening on 0.0.0.0:8528 (:8528)`.

As the port of the _Starter_ is a configurable variable, please identify and use
the one of your specific setup.

You might use _curl_ to send the `POST` request. For example:

```
curl -X POST --dump - http://localhost:8538/database-auto-upgrade

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Wed, 09 May 2018 10:35:35 GMT
Content-Length: 2
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
```

Response `200 OK` means that the request was accepted and the upgrade process
for this _Starter_ has begun.

### _Starter_ response

The _Starter_ will respond to the HTTP `POST` request depending on the deployment
mode.

#### Deployment mode `single`

The _Starter_ will:

- Restart the single server with an additional `--database.auto-upgrade=true` argument.
  The server will perform the auto-upgrade and then stop.
  After that the _Starter_ will automatically restart it with its normal arguments.

#### Deployment mode `activefailover`

The _Starter_ will:

- Turning off _supervision_ in the _Agency_ and wait for it to be confirmed.
- Restarting one _Agent_ at a time with an additional `--database.auto-upgrade=true` argument.
  The _Agent_ will perform the auto-upgrade and then stop.
  After that the _Starter_ will automatically restart it with its normal arguments.
- Restarting one single server at a time with an additional `--database.auto-upgrade=true` argument.
  This server will perform the auto-upgrade and then stop.
  After that the _Starter_ will automatically restart it with its normal arguments.
- Turning on _supervision_ in the _Agency_ and wait for it to be confirmed.

#### Deployment mode `cluster`

The _Starter_ will:

- Turning off _supervision_ in the _Agency_ and wait for it to be confirmed.
- Restarting one _Agent_ at a time with an additional `--database.auto-upgrade=true` argument.
  The _Agent_ will perform the auto-upgrade and then stop.
  After that the _Starter_ will automatically restart it with its normal arguments.
- Restarting one _DBSserver_ at a time with an additional `--database.auto-upgrade=true` argument.
  This _DBSserver_ will perform the auto-upgrade and then stop.
  After that the _Starter_ will automatically restart it with its normal arguments.
- Restarting one _Coordinator_ at a time with an additional `--database.auto-upgrade=true` argument.
  This _Coordinator_ will perform the auto-upgrade and then stop.
  After that the _Starter_ will automatically restart it with its normal arguments.
- Turning on _supervision_ in the _Agency_ and wait for it to be confirmed.


Example: Rolling Upgrade in a Cluster
-------------------------------------

In this example we will perform a rolling upgrade of an ArangoDB Cluster setup
from version 3.3.7 to version 3.3.8. 

Once a `POST` request to the first _Starter_ is sent, the following output is shown
when the upgrade has finished:

```

```

_Agent_ 1, _DBSserver_ 1 and _Coordinator_ 1 are successively updated and the last
messages indicate that the `POST` request can be sent so the next _Starter_. After this
procedure has been repeated for every _Starter_ the last _Starter_ will show:

```

2018/05/09 12:35:59 agent 1        3.3.8

2018/05/09 12:35:59 Upgrading done.
```

All _Agents_, _DBServers_ and _Coordinators_ are upgraded and the rolling upgrade
has successfully finished.
