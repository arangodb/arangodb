# Upgrading _Starter_ Deployments

Starting from versions 3.2.15 and 3.3.8, the ArangoDB [_Starter_](../../Programs/Starter/README.md)
supports a new, automated, procedure to perform upgrades, including rolling upgrades
of a [Cluster](../../Architecture/DeploymentModes/Cluster/README.md) setup.

The upgrade procedure of the _Starter_ described in this _Section_ can be used to
upgrade to a new hotfix, or to perform an upgrade to a new minor version of ArangoDB.
Please refer to the [Upgrade Paths](../GeneralInfo/README.md#upgrade-paths) section
for detailed information.

**Important:** rolling upgrades of Cluster setups from 3.2 to 3.3 are only supported
from versions 3.2.15 and 3.3.9.

## Upgrade Procedure

The following procedure has to be executed on every ArangoDB _Starter_ instance.
It is assumed that a _Starter_ deployment with mode `single`, `activefailover` or
`cluster` is running.

### Install the new ArangoDB version binary

Installing the new ArangoDB version binary also includes the latest ArangoDB _Starter_
binary, which is necessary to perform the rolling upgrade.

The first step is to install the new ArangoDB package.

**Note:** you do not have to stop the _Starter_ processes before upgrading it.

For example, if you want to upgrade to `3.3.14-1` on Debian or Ubuntu, either call

```bash
apt install arangodb=3.3.14
```

(`apt-get` on older versions) if you have added the ArangoDB repository. Or
install a specific package using

```bash
dpkg -i arangodb3-3.3.14-1_amd64.deb
```

after you have downloaded the corresponding file from https://download.arangodb.com/.

#### Stop the Standalone Instance

As the package will automatically start the standalone instance, you might want to
stop it now, as otherwise this standalone instance that is started on your machine
can create some confusion later. As you are using the _Starter_ you do not need
this standalone instance, and you can hence stop it:

```bash
service arangodb3 stop
```

Also, you might want to remove the standalone instance from the default
_runlevels_ to prevent it to start on the next reboot of your machine. How this
is done depends on your distribution and _init_ system. For example, on older Debian
and Ubuntu systems using a SystemV-compatible _init_, you can use:

```bash
update-rc.d -f arangodb3 remove
```

### Stop the _Starter_ without stopping the ArangoDB Server processes

Now all the _Starter_ (_arangodb_) processes have to be stopped.

Please note that **no** _arangod_ processes should be stopped.

In order to stop the _arangodb_ processes, leaving the _arangod_ processes they
have started up and running (as we want for a rolling upgrade), we will need to
use a command like `kill -9`:

```bash
kill -9 <pid-of-starter>
```

The _pid_ associated to your _Starter_ can be checked using a command like _ps_:

```bash
ps -C arangodb -fww
```

The output of the command above does not only show the PID's of all _arangodb_
processes but also the used commands, which can be useful for the following
restart of all _arangodb_ processes.

The output below is from a test machine where three instances of a _Starter_ are
running locally. In a more production-like scenario, you will find only one instance
of _arangodb_ running:

```bash
ps -C arangodb -fww
UID        PID  PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
max      29419  3684  0 11:46 pts/1    00:00:00 arangodb --starter.data-dir=./db1
max      29504  3695  0 11:46 pts/2    00:00:00 arangodb --starter.data-dir=./db2 --starter.join 127.0.0.1
max      29513  3898  0 11:46 pts/4    00:00:00 arangodb --starter.data-dir=./db3 --starter.join 127.0.0.1
```

### Restart the _Starter_

When using a supervisor like _SystemD_, this will happens automatically. In case
the _Starter_ was initiated manually, the _arangodb_ processes have to be restarted
manually with the same command that has been used before.

After you have restarted the _Starter_ you will find yourself in the following
situation:

- The _Starter_ is up and running, and it is on the new version
- The ArangoDB Server processes are up and running, and they are still on the
  old version

### Start the upgrade process of all _arangod_ & _arangosync_ servers

Run the following command:

```bash
arangodb upgrade --starter.endpoint=<endpoint-of-a-starter>
```

The `--starter.endpoint` option can be set to the endpoint of any
of the starters. E.g. `http://localhost:8528`.

**Important:**

The command above was introduced with 3.3.14 (and 3.2.17). If you are rolling upgrade a 3.3.x version
to a version higher or equal to 3.3.14, or if you are rolling upgrade a 3.2.x version to a version higher
or equal to 3.2.17 please use the command above.

If you are doing the rolling upgrade of a 3.3.x version to a version between 3.3.8 and 3.3.13 (included),
or if you are rolling upgrade a 3.2.x version to 3.2.15 or 3.2.16, a different command has to be used
(on all _Starters_ one by one):

```
curl -X POST --dump - http://localhost:8538/database-auto-upgrade
```

#### Deployment mode `single`

For deployment mode `single`, the `arangodb upgrade` command will:

- Restart the single server with an additional `--database.auto-upgrade=true` argument.
  The server will perform the auto-upgrade and then stop.
  After that the _Starter_ will automatically restart it with its normal arguments.

The `arangodb upgrade` command will complete right away.
Inspect the log of the _Starter_ to know when the upgrade has finished.

#### Deployment mode `activefailover` or `cluster`

The _Starters_ will now perform an initial check that upgrading is possible
and when that all succeeds, create an upgrade _plan_. This _plan_ is then 
executed by every _Starter_.

The `arangodb upgrade` command will show the progress of the upgrade
and stop when the upgrade has either finished successfully or finished
with an error.

### Retrying a failed upgrade

Starting with 3.3.14 and 3.2.17, when an upgrade _plan_ (in deployment
mode `activefailover` or `cluster`) has failed, it can be retried.

To retry, run:

```bash
arangodb retry upgrade --starter.endpoint=<endpoint-of-a-starter>
```

The `--starter.endpoint` option can be set to the endpoint of any
of the starters. E.g. `http://localhost:8528`.

### Aborting an upgrade

Starting with 3.3.14 and 3.2.17, when an upgrade _plan_ (in deployment
mode `activefailover` or `cluster`) is in progress or has failed, it can
be aborted.

To abort, run:

```bash
arangodb abort upgrade --starter.endpoint=<endpoint-of-a-starter>
```

The `--starter.endpoint` option can be set to the endpoint of any
of the starters. E.g. `http://localhost:8528`.

Note that an abort does not stop all upgrade processes immediately.
If an _arangod_ or _arangosync_ server is being upgraded when the abort
was issued, this upgrade will be finished. Remaining servers will not be
upgraded.
