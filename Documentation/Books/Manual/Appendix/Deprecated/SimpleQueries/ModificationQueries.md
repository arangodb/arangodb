!CHAPTER Modification Queries

ArangoDB also allows removing, replacing, and updating documents based 
on an example document. Every document in the collection will be 
compared against the specified example document and be deleted/replaced/
updated if all attributes match.

These method should be used with caution as they are intended to remove or
modify lots of documents in a collection.

All methods can optionally be restricted to a specific number of operations.
However, if a limit is specific but is less than the number of matches, it
will be undefined which of the matching documents will get removed/modified.
[Remove by Example](../../../DataModeling/Documents/DocumentMethods.md#remove-by-example),
 [Replace by Example](../../../DataModeling/Documents/DocumentMethods.md#replace-by-example) and 
[Update by Example](../../../DataModeling/Documents/DocumentMethods.md#update-by-example)
 are described with examples in the subchapter 
[Collection Methods](../../../DataModeling/Documents/DocumentMethods.md).
