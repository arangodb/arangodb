Deprecated
==========

Features listed in this section should no longer be used, because they are
considered obsolete and may get removed in a future release. They are currently
kept for backward compatibility. There are usually better alternatives to
replace the old features with:

- **Simple Queries**: Ideomatic interface in arangosh to perform trivial queries.
  They are superseded by [AQL queries](../../../AQL/index.html), which can also
  be run in arangosh. AQL is a language on its own and way more powerful than
  *Simple Queries* could ever be. In fact, the (still supported) *Simple Queries*
  are translated internally to AQL, then the AQL query is optimized and run
  against the database in recent versions, because of better performance and
  reduced maintenance complexity.

- **Actions**: Snippets of JavaScript code on the server-side for minimal
  custom endpoints. Since the Foxx revamp in 3.0, it became really easy to
  write [Foxx Microservices](../../Foxx/README.md), which allow you to define
  custom endpoints even with complex business logic.
