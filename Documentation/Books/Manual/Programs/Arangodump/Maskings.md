Arangodump Data Maskings
========================

*--maskings path-of-config*

It is possible to mask certain fields for a dump. A JSON configuration file is
used to define which fields should be masked and how.

The general structure of the config file looks like this:

```json
{
  "collection-name": {
    "type": MASKING_TYPE
    "maskings" : [
      MASKING1,
      MASKING2,
      ...
    ]
  },
  ...
}
```

Using `"*"` as collection name defines a default behavior for collections not
listed explicitly.

Masking Types
-------------

`type` is a string describing how to mask the given collection.
Possible values are:

- `"exclude"`: the collection is ignored completely and not even the structure data
  is dumped.

- `"structure"`: only the collection structure is dumped, but no data at all

- `"masked"`: the collection structure and all data is dumped. However, the data
  is subject to obfuscation defined in the attribute `maskings`.

- `"full"`: the collection structure and all data is dumped. No masking is
  applied to this collection at all.

**Example**

```json
{
  "private": {
    "type": "exclude"
  },

  "log": {
    "type": "structure"
  },

  "person": {
    "type": "masked",
    "maskings": [
      {
        "path": "name",
        "type": "xifyFront",
        "unmaskedLength": 2
      },
      {
        "path": ".security_id",
        "type": "xifyFront",
        "unmaskedLength": 2
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

In the example the collection _private_ is completely ignored. Only the
structure of the collection _log_ is dumped, but not the data itself.
The collection _person_ is dumped completely but with the _name_ field masked
if it occurs on the top-level. It also masks fields with the name "security_id"
anywhere in the document. See below for a complete description of the parameters
of [type "xifyFront"](#xify-front).

### Masking vs. dump-data option

*arangodump* also supports a very coarse masking with the option
`--dump-data false`. This basically removes all data from the dump.

You can either use `--masking` or `--dump-data false`, but not both.

### Masking vs. include-collection option

*arangodump* also supports a very coarse masking with the option
`--include-collection`. This will restrict the collections that are
dumped to the ones explicitly listed.

It is possible to combine `--masking` and `--include-collection`.
This will take the intersection of exportable collections.

Path
----

If the path starts with a `.` then it is considered to match any path
ending in `name`. For example, `.name` will match the attribute name
`name` all leaf attributes in the document. Leaf attributes are
attributes whose value is `null` or of data type `string`, `number`,
`bool` and `array` (see below). `name` will only match leaf attributes
at top level. `person.name` will match the attribute `name` of a leaf
in the top-level object `person`.

If you have an attribute name that contains a dot, you need to quote the
name with either a tick or a backtick. For example:

    "path": "´name.with.dots´"

or

    "path": "`name.with.dots`"

If the attribute value is an array the masking is applied to all the
array elements individually.

**Example**

The following configuration will replace the value of the "name"
attribute with an "XXXX"-masked string:

```json
{
  "type": "xifyFront",
  "path": ".name",
  "unmaskedLength": 2
}
```

The document:

```json
{
  "name": "top-level-name",
  "age": 42,
  "nicknames" : [ { "name": "hugo" }, "egon" ],
  "other": {
    "name": [ "emil", { "secret": "superman" } ]
  }
}
```

… will be changed as follows:

```json
{
  "name": "xxxxxxxxxxxxme",
  "age": 42,
  "nicknames" : [ { "name": "xxgo" }, "egon" ],
  "other": {
    "name": [ "xxil", { "secret": "superman" } ]
  }
}
```

The values `"egon"` and `"superman"` are not replaced, because they
are not contained in an attribute value of which the attribute name is
`name`.

### Nested objects and arrays

If you specify a path and the attribute value is an array then the
masking decision is applied to each element of the array as if this
was the value of the attribute.

If the attribute value is an object, then the attribute is not masked.
Instead the nested object is checked further for leaf attributes.

**Example**

Masking `email` will convert:


```json
{ 
  "email" : "email address" 
}
```

… into:

```json
{ 
  "email" : "xxil xxxxxxss" 
}
```

because `email` is a leaf attribute. The document:

```json
{ 
  "email" : [ 
    "address one", 
    "address two" 
  ] 
} 
```

… will be converted into:

```json
{ 
  "email" : [ 
    "xxxxxss xne", 
    "xxxxxss xwo" 
  ] 
} 
```

… because the array is "unfolded". The document:

```json
{ 
  "email" : { 
    "address" : "email address" 
  } 
}
```

… will not be changed because `email` is not a leaf attribute.

### Random string

```json
{
  "path": ".name",
  "type": "randomString"
}
```

This masking type will replace all values of attributes with key
`name` with an anonymized string. It is not guaranteed that the string
will be of the same length.

A hash of the original string is computed. If the original string is
shorter then the hash will be used. This will result in a longer
replacement string. If the string is longer than the hash then
characters will be repeated as many times as needed to reach the full
original string length.

**Example**

Masking name as above, the document:

```json
{ 
  "_key" : "38937", 
  "_id" : "examplecollection/38937", 
  "_rev" : "_YFaGG1u--_", 
  "name" : [ 
    "My Name", 
    { 
      "other" : "Hallo Name" 
    }, 
    [ 
      "Name One", 
      "Name Two" 
    ], 
    true, 
    false, 
    null,
    1.0,
    1234,
    "This is a very long name"
  ] 
}
```

… will be converted into

```json
{
  "_key": "38937",
  "_id": "examplecollection/38937",
  "_rev": "_YFaGG1u--_",
  "name": [
    "+y5OQiYmp/o=",
    {
      "other": "Hallo Name"
    },
    [
      "ihCTrlsKKdk=",
      "yo/55hfla0U="
    ],
    true,
    false,
    null,
    1.0,
    1234,
    "hwjAfNe5BGw=hwjAfNe5BGw="
  ]
}
```

### Xify front

This masking type replaces the front characters with `x` and
blanks. Alphanumeric characters, `_` and `-` are replaced by `x`,
everything else is replaced by a blank.

```json
{
  "path": ".name",
  "type": "xifyFront",
  "unmaskedLength": 2
}
```

This will mask all alphanumeric characters of a word except the last
two characters.  Words of length 1 and 2 are unmasked. If the
attribute value is not a string the result will be `xxxx`.

    "This is a test!Do you agree?"

… will become

    "xxis is a xxst Do xou xxxee "

There is a catch. If you have an index on the attribute the masking
might distort the index efficiency or even cause errors in case of a
unique index.

```json
{
  "type": "xifyFront",
  "path": ".name",
  "unmaskedLength": 2,
  "hash": true
}
```

This will add a hash at the end of the string.

    "This is a test!Do you agree?"

… will become

    "xxis is a xxst Do xou xxxee  NAATm8c9hVQ="

Note that the hash is based on a random secrect that is different for
each run. This avoids dictionary attacks which can be used to guess
values based pre-computations on dictionaries.

If you need reproducible results, i.e. hashes that do not change between
different runs of *arangodump*, you need to specify a secret as seed,
a number which must not be `0`.

```json
{
  "type": "xifyFront",
  "path": ".name",
  "unmaskedLength": 2,
  "hash": true,
  "seed": 246781478647
}
```

### Zip

This masking type replaces a zip code with a random one.  If the
attribute value is not a string then the default value of `"12345"` is
used as no zip is known. You can change the default value, see below.

```json
{
  "path": ".code",
  "type": "zip",
}
```

This will replace a real zip code with a random one. It uses the following
rule: If a character of the original zip code is a digit it will be replaced
by a random digit. If a character of the original zip code is a letter it
will be replaced by a random letter keeping the case.

```json
{
  "path": ".code",
  "type": "zip",
  "default": "abcdef"
}
```

**Example**

If the original zip code is:

    50674

… it will be replaced by e.g.:

    98146

If the original zip code is:

    SA34-EA

… it will be replaced by e.g.:

    OW91-JI

Note that this will generate random zip code. Therefore there is a
chance generate the same zip code value multiple times, which can
cause unique constraint violations if a unique index is or will be
used on the zip code attribute.

### Datetime

This masking type replaces the value of the attribute with a random
date.

```json
{
  "type": "datetime",
  "begin" : "2019-01-01",
  "end": "2019-12-31",
  "format": "%yyyy-%mm-%dd",
}
```

`begin` and `end` are in ISO8601 format.

The format is described in
[DATE_FORMAT](../../../AQL/Functions/Date.html#dateformat).

### Integral number

This masking type replaces the value of the attribute with a random
integral number.  It will replace the value even if it is a string,
boolean, or false.

```json
{
  "type": "integer",
  "lower" : -100,
  "upper": 100
}
```

### Decimal number

This masking type replaces the value of the attribute with a random
decimal.  It will replace the value even if it is a string, boolean,
or false.

```json
{
  "type": "float",
  "lower" : -0.3,
  "upper": 0.3
}
```

By default, the decimal has a scale of 2. I.e. it has at most 2
decimal digits. The definition:

```json
{
  "type": "float",
  "lower" : -0.3,
  "upper": 0.3,
  "scale": 3
}
```

… will generate numbers with at most 3 decimal digits.

### Credit card number

This masking type replaces the value of the attribute with a random
credit card number.

```json
{
  "type": "creditCard",
}
```

See [Luhn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm) for details.

### Phone number

This masking type replaces a phone number with a random one. If the
attribute value is not a string it is replaced by the string
`"+1234567890"`.

```json
{
  "type": "phone",
  "default": "+4912345123456789"
}
```

This will replace an existing phone number with a random one. It uses
the following rule: If a character of the original number is a digit
it will be replaced by a random digit. If it is a letter it is replaced
by a letter. All other characters are unchanged.

```json
{  "type": "zip",
  "default": "+4912345123456789"
}
```

If the attribute value is not a string use the value of default
`"+4912345123456789"`.

### Email address

This masking type takes an email address, computes a hash value and
split it into three equal parts `AAAA`, `BBBB`, and `CCCC`. The
resulting email address is `AAAA.BBBB@CCCC.invalid`.
