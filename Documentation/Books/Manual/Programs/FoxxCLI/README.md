# Foxx CLI

Foxx CLI is command line tool for managing and developing ArangoDB
Foxx services. It is an optional tool which requires Node.js and
can be installed via the package managers NPM and Yarn.

It is the successor of `foxx-manager`, which is deprecated and will be
removed eventually. Also see [Foxx Deployment](../../Foxx/Deployment.md)
for additional deployment options.
