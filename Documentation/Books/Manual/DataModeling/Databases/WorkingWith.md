Working with Databases
======================

### Database Methods

The following methods are available to manage databases via JavaScript.
Please note that several of these methods can be used from the _system
database only.

### Name
<!-- arangod/V8Server/v8-vocbase.cpp -->


return the database name
`db._name()`

Returns the name of the current database as a string.


**Examples**


@startDocuBlockInline dbName
@EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT{dbName}
  require("@arangodb").db._name();
@END_EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT
@endDocuBlock dbName


### ID
<!-- arangod/V8Server/v8-vocbase.cpp -->


return the database id
`db._id()`

Returns the id of the current database as a string.


**Examples**


@startDocuBlockInline dbId
@EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT{dbId}
  require("@arangodb").db._id();
@END_EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT
@endDocuBlock dbId


### Path
<!-- arangod/V8Server/v8-vocbase.cpp -->


return the path to database files
`db._path()`

Returns the filesystem path of the current database as a string.


**Examples**


@startDocuBlockInline dbPath
@EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT{dbPath}
  require("@arangodb").db._path();
@END_EXAMPLE_ARANGOSH_OUTPUT
@endDocuBlock dbPath


### isSystem
<!-- arangod/V8Server/v8-vocbase.cpp -->


return the database type
`db._isSystem()`

Returns whether the currently used database is the *_system* database.
The system database has some special privileges and properties, for example,
database management operations such as create or drop can only be executed
from within this database. Additionally, the *_system* database itself
cannot be dropped.


### Use Database
<!-- arangod/V8Server/v8-vocbase.cpp -->


change the current database
`db._useDatabase(name)`

Changes the current database to the database specified by *name*. Note
that the database specified by *name* must already exist.

Changing the database might be disallowed in some contexts, for example
server-side actions (including Foxx).

When performing this command from arangosh, the current credentials (username
and password) will be re-used. These credentials might not be valid to
connect to the database specified by *name*. Additionally, the database
only be accessed from certain endpoints only. In this case, switching the
database might not work, and the connection / session should be closed and
restarted with different username and password credentials and/or
endpoint data.


### List Databases
<!-- arangod/V8Server/v8-vocbase.cpp -->


return the list of all existing databases
`db._databases()`

Returns the list of all databases. This method can only be used from within
the *_system* database.


### Create Database
<!-- arangod/V8Server/v8-vocbase.cpp -->


create a new database
`db._createDatabase(name, options, users)`

Creates a new database with the name specified by *name*.
There are restrictions for database names
(see [DatabaseNames](../NamingConventions/DatabaseNames.md)).

Note that even if the database is created successfully, there will be no
change into the current database to the new database. Changing the current
database must explicitly be requested by using the
*db._useDatabase* method.

The *options* attribute currently has no meaning and is reserved for
future use.

The optional *users* attribute can be used to create initial users for
the new database. If specified, it must be a list of user objects. Each user
object can contain the following attributes:

* *username*: the user name as a string. This attribute is mandatory.
* *passwd*: the user password as a string. If not specified, then it defaults
  to an empty string.
* *active*: a boolean flag indicating whether the user account should be
  active or not. The default value is *true*.
* *extra*: an optional JSON object with extra user information. The data
  contained in *extra* will be stored for the user but not be interpreted
  further by ArangoDB.

If no initial users are specified, a default user *root* will be created
with an empty string password. This ensures that the new database will be
accessible via HTTP after it is created.

You can create users in a database if no initial user is specified. Switch 
into the new database (username and password must be identical to the current
session) and add or modify users with the following commands.

```js
  require("@arangodb/users").save(username, password, true);
  require("@arangodb/users").update(username, password, true);
  require("@arangodb/users").remove(username);
```
Alternatively, you can specify user data directly. For example:

```js
  db._createDatabase("newDB", [], [{ username: "newUser", passwd: "123456", active: true}])
```

Those methods can only be used from within the *_system* database.


### Drop Database
<!-- arangod/V8Server/v8-vocbase.cpp -->


drop an existing database
`db._dropDatabase(name)`

Drops the database specified by *name*. The database specified by
*name* must exist.

**Note**: Dropping databases is only possible from within the *_system*
database. The *_system* database itself cannot be dropped.

Databases are dropped asynchronously, and will be physically removed if
all clients have disconnected and references have been garbage-collected.
