!BOOK ArangoDB VERSION_NUMBER Documentation

Welcome to the ArangoDB documentation!

The documentation introduces ArangoDB for you as a user, developer and administrator and describes all of its functions in detail. 

New and eager to try it out? Start right away with our beginner's guide: [Getting Started](GettingStarted/README.md)

ArangoDB is a multi-model, open-source database with flexible data models for documents, graphs, and key-values. Build high performance applications using a convenient SQL-like query language or JavaScript extensions. Use ACID transactions if you require them. Scale horizontally and vertically with a few mouse clicks.

Key features include:

* **Schema-free schemata** let you combine the space efficiency of MySQL with the performance power of NoSQL
* Use ArangoDB as an **application server** and fuse your application and database together for maximal throughput
* JavaScript for all: **no language zoo**, you can use one language from your browser to your back-end
* ArangoDB is **multi-threaded** - exploit the power of all your cores
* **Flexible data modeling**: model your data as combination of key-value pairs, documents or graphs - perfect for social relations
* Free **index choice**: use the correct index for your problem, be it a skip list or a fulltext search
* Configurable **durability**: let the application decide if it needs more durability or more performance
* No-nonsense storage: ArangoDB uses all of the power of **modern storage hardware**, like SSD and large caches
* **Powerful query language** (AQL) to retrieve and modify data 
* **Transactions**: run queries on multiple documents or collections with optional transactional consistency and isolation
* **Replication** and **Sharding**: set up the database in a master-slave configuration or spread bigger datasets across multiple servers
* It is **open source** (Apache License 2.0)

In this documentation you can inform yourself about all the functions, features and programs ArangoDB provides for you.
Features are illustrated with interactive usage examples; you can cut'n'paste them into [arangosh](Administration/Arangosh/README.md) to try them out.
The http REST-API is demonstrated with cut'n'paste recepies intended to be used with the [cURL](http://curl.haxx.se).
Drivers may provide their own examples based on these .js based examples to improve understandeability for their respective users.
I.e. for the [java driver](https://github.com/arangodb/arangodb-java-driver#learn-more) some of the samples are re-implemented.

You can also go to our [cookbook](https://docs.arangodb.com/cookbook) and look through some recipes to learn more about ArangoDB specific problems and solutions.
