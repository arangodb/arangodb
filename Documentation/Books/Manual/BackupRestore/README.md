Backup and Restore
==================

Backup and restore can be done via the tools [_arangodump_](../Programs/Arangodump/README.md)
and [_arangorestore_](../Programs/Arangorestore/README.md).

Performing frequent backups is important and a recommended best practices that can allow you to recover your data in case unexpected problems occur. Hardware failures, system crashes, or users mistakenly deleting data can always happen. Furthermore, while a big effort is put into the development and testing of ArangoDB (in all its deployment modes), ArangoDB, as any other software product, might include bugs or errors. It is therefore important to regularly backup your data to be able to recover and get up an running again in case of serious problems.

Backup-ing up your data before an ArangoDB upgrade is also a best practice.
