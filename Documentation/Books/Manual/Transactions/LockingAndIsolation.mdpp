!CHAPTER Locking and Isolation 

All collections specified in the *collections* attribute are locked in the
requested mode (read or write) at transaction start. Locking of multiple collections
is performed in alphabetical order.
When a transaction commits or rolls back, all locks are released in reverse order.
The locking order is deterministic to avoid deadlocks.

While locks are held, modifications by other transactions to the collections 
participating in the transaction are prevented.
A transaction will thus see a consistent view of the participating collections' data.

Additionally, a transaction will not be interrupted or interleaved with any other 
ongoing operations on the same collection. This means each transaction will run in
isolation. A transaction should never see uncommitted or rolled back modifications by
other transactions. Additionally, reads inside a transaction are repeatable.

Note that the above is true only for all collections that are declared in the 
*collections* attribute of the transaction.

!SUBSECTION Lazily adding collections

There might be situations when declaring all collections a priori is not possible,
for example, because further collections are determined by a dynamic AQL query 
inside the transaction, for example a query using AQL graph functions.

In this case, it would be impossible to know beforehand which collection to lock, and
thus it is legal to not declare collections that will be accessed in the transaction in
read-only mode. Accessing a non-declared collection in read-only mode during a 
transaction will add the collection to the transaction lazily, and fetch data 
from the collection as usual. However, as the collection ie added lazily, there is no 
isolation from other concurrent operations or transactions. Reads from such
collections are potentially non-repeatable.

**EXAMPLES**:

```js
db._executeTransaction({
  collections: { 
    read: "users"
  },
  action: function () {
    /* execute an AQL query that traverses a graph starting at a "users" vertex. 
       it is yet unknown into which other collections the query will traverse */
    db._createStatement({ 
      query: "FOR t IN TRAVERSAL(users, connections, "users/1234", "any", { }) RETURN t"
    }).execute().toArray().forEach(function (d) {
      /* ... */
    });
  }
});
```

This automatic lazy addition of collections to a transaction also introduces the 
possibility of deadlocks. Deadlocks may occur if there are concurrent transactions 
that try to acquire locks on the same collections lazily.

In order to make a transaction fail when a non-declared collection is used inside
a transaction for reading, the optional *allowImplicit* sub-attribute of *collections* 
can be set to *false*:

```js
db._executeTransaction({
  collections: { 
    read: "users",
    allowImplicit: false
  },
  action: function () {
    /* the below query will now fail because the collection connections has not 
       been specified in the list of collections used by the transaction */
    db._createStatement({ 
      query: "FOR t IN TRAVERSAL(users, connections, "users/1234", "any", { }) RETURN t"
    }).execute().toArray().forEach(function (d) {
      /* ... */
    });
  }
});
```

The default value for *allowImplicit* is *true*. Write-accessing collections that
have not been declared in the *collections* array is never possible, regardless of
the value of *allowImplicit*.

!SUBSECTION Deadlocks and Deadlock detection

A deadlock is a situation in which two or more concurrent operations (user transactions
or AQL queries) try to access the same resources (collections, documents) and need to 
wait for the others to finish, but none of them can make any progress.

A good example for a deadlock is two concurrently executing transactions T1 and T2 that
try to access the same collections but that need to wait for each other. In this example,
transaction T1 will write to collection `c1`, but will also read documents from
collection `c2` without announcing it:

```js
db._executeTransaction({
  collections: { 
    write: "c1"
  },
  action: function () {
    var db = require("@arangodb").db;

    /* write into c1 (announced) */
    db.c1.insert({ foo: "bar" });

    /* some operation here that takes long to execute... */

    /* read from c2 (unannounced) */
    db.c2.toArray();
  }
});
```

Transaction T2 announces to write into collection `c2`, but will also read 
documents from collection `c1` without announcing it:

```js
db._executeTransaction({
  collections: { 
    write: "c2"
  },
  action: function () {
    var db = require("@arangodb").db;

    /* write into c2 (announced) */
    db.c2.insert({ bar: "baz" });
    
    /* some operation here that takes long to execute... */
    
    /* read from c1 (unannounced) */
    db.c1.toArray();
  }
});
```

In the above example, a deadlock will occur if transaction T1 and T2 have both
acquired their write locks (T1 for collection `c1` and T2 for collection `c2`) and
are then trying to read from the other other (T1 will read from `c2`, T2 will read
from `c1`). T1 will then try to acquire the read lock on collection `c2`, which
is prevented by transaction T2. T2 however will wait for the read lock on 
collection `c1`, which is prevented by transaction T1. 

In case of such deadlock, there would be no progress for any of the involved 
transactions, and none of the involved transactions could ever complete. This is
completely undesirable, so the automatic deadlock detection mechanism in ArangoDB
will automatically abort one of the transactions involved in such deadlock. Aborting
means that all changes done by the transaction will be rolled back and error 29 
(`deadlock detected`) will be thrown. 

Client code (AQL queries, user transactions) that accesses more than one collection 
should be aware of the potential of deadlocks and should handle the error 29 
(`deadlock detected`) properly, either by passing the exception to the caller or 
retrying the operation.

To avoid both deadlocks and non-repeatable reads, all collections used in a 
transaction should be specified in the `collections` attribute when known in advance.
In case this is not possible because collections are added dynamically inside the
transaction, deadlocks may occur and the deadlock detection may kick in and abort
the transaction.
