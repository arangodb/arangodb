Known Issues
============

The following known issues are present in this version of ArangoDB and will be fixed
in follow-up releases:

Installer
---------

* Rolling upgrades are not yet supported with the RC version of ArangoDB 3.4, when
  there are multiple instances of the same ArangoDB version running on the same host,
  and only some of them shall be upgraded, or they should be upgraded one after the
  other.


Modify documents in cluster using AQL and an incorrect custom shard key
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

* In a very uncommon edge case there is an issue with an optimization rule in the cluster.

  If you are running a cluster and use a custom shard key on a collection (default is `_key`)
  **and** you provide a wrong shard key in a modifying query (`UPDATE`, `REPLACE`, `DELETE`)
  **and** the wrong shard key is on a different shard than the correct one, you'll get a
  `DOCUMENT NOT FOUND` error, instead of a modification.

  The modification always happens if the rule is switched off.

  Example query:

      UPDATE { _key: "123", shardKey: "wrongKey"} WITH { foo: "bar" } IN mycollection

  If your setup could run into this issue you may want to
  [deactivate the optimizing rule](../../AQL/ExecutionAndPerformance/Optimizer.html#turning-specific-optimizer-rules-off)
  `restrict-to-single-shard`.

More details can be found in [issue 6399](https://github.com/arangodb/arangodb/issues/6399).


ArangoSearch
------------

* ArangoSearch index format in 3.4RC3 is incompatible to earlier issued release candidates
* ArangoSearch ignores `_id` attribute even if `includeAllFields` is set to `true` (internal #445)
* Using score functions (BM25/TFIDF) in ArangoDB expression is not supported (internal #316)
* Using a loop variable in expressions within a corresponding SEARCH condition is not supported (internal #318)
* RocksDB recovery fails sometimes after renaming a view (internal #469)
