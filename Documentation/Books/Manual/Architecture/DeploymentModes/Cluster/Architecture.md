Cluster Architecture
====================

The cluster architecture of ArangoDB is a _CP_ master/master model with no
single point of failure. With "CP" we mean that in the presence of a
network partition, the database prefers internal consistency over
availability. With "master/master" we mean that clients can send their
requests to an arbitrary node, and experience the same view on the
database regardless. "No single point of failure" means that the cluster
can continue to serve requests, even if one machine fails completely.

In this way, ArangoDB has been designed as a distributed multi-model
database. This section gives a short outline on the cluster architecture and
how the above features and capabilities are achieved.

Structure of an ArangoDB Cluster
--------------------------------

An ArangoDB Cluster consists of a number of ArangoDB instances
which talk to each other over the network. They play different roles,
which will be explained in detail below. The current configuration
of the Cluster is held in the _Agency_, which is a highly-available
resilient key/value store based on an odd number of ArangoDB instances
running [Raft Consensus Protocol](https://raft.github.io/).

For the various instances in an ArangoDB Cluster there are 3 distinct
roles:

- _Agents_
- _Coordinators_
- _DBServers_.

In the following sections we will shed light on each of them.

### Agents

One or multiple _Agents_ form the _Agency_ in an ArangoDB Cluster. The
_Agency_ is the central place to store the configuration in a Cluster. It
performs leader elections and provides other synchronization services for
the whole Cluster. Without the _Agency_ none of the other components can
operate.

While generally invisible to the outside the _Agency_ is the heart of the
Cluster. As such, fault tolerance is of course a must have for the
_Agency_. To achieve that the _Agents_ are using the [Raft Consensus
Algorithm](https://raft.github.io/). The algorithm formally guarantees
conflict free configuration management within the ArangoDB Cluster.

At its core the _Agency_ manages a big configuration tree. It supports
transactional read and write operations on this tree, and other servers
can subscribe to HTTP callbacks for all changes to the tree.

### Coordinators

_Coordinators_ should be accessible from the outside. These are the ones
the clients talk to. They will coordinate cluster tasks like
executing queries and running Foxx services. They know where the
data is stored and will optimize where to run user supplied queries or
parts thereof. _Coordinators_ are stateless and can thus easily be shut down
and restarted as needed.

### DBServers

DBservers are the ones where the data is actually hosted. They
host shards of data and using synchronous replication a DBServer may
either be leader or follower for a shard.

They should not be accessed from the outside but indirectly through the
_Coordinators_. They may also execute queries in part or as a whole when
asked by a _Coordinator_.

Many sensible configurations
----------------------------

This architecture is very flexible and thus allows many configurations,
which are suitable for different usage scenarios:

 1. The default configuration is to run exactly one _Coordinator_ and
    one _DBServer_ on each machine. This achieves the classical
    master/master setup, since there is a perfect symmetry between the
    different nodes, clients can equally well talk to any one of the
    _Coordinators_ and all expose the same view to the data store. _Agents_
    can run on separate, less powerful machines.
 2. One can deploy more _Coordinators_ than _DBservers_. This is a sensible
    approach if one needs a lot of CPU power for the Foxx services,
    because they run on the _Coordinators_.
 3. One can deploy more _DBServers_ than _Coordinators_ if more data capacity
    is needed and the query performance is the lesser bottleneck
 4. One can deploy a _Coordinator_ on each machine where an application
    server (e.g. a node.js server) runs, and the _Agents_ and _DBServers_
    on a separate set of machines elsewhere. This avoids a network hop
    between the application server and the database and thus decreases
    latency. Essentially, this moves some of the database distribution
    logic to the machine where the client runs.

As you acn see, the _Coordinator_ layer can be scaled and deployed independently
from the _DBServer_ layer.

Cluster ID
----------

Every non-Agency ArangoDB instance in a Cluster is assigned a unique
ID during its startup. Using its ID a node is identifiable
throughout the Cluster. All cluster operations will communicate
via this ID.

Sharding
--------

Using the roles outlined above an ArangoDB Cluster is able to distribute
data in so called _shards_ across multiple _DBServers_. From the outside
this process is fully transparent and as such we achieve the goals of
what other systems call "master-master replication".

In an ArangoDB Cluster you talk to any _Coordinator_ and whenever you read or write data
it will automatically figure out where the data is stored (read) or to
be stored (write). The information about the _shards_ is shared across the
_Coordinators_ using the _Agency_.

ArangoDB organizes its collection data in _shards_. Sharding
allows to use multiple machines to run a cluster of ArangoDB
instances that together constitute a single database. This enables
you to store much more data, since ArangoDB distributes the data
automatically to the different servers. In many situations one can
also reap a benefit in data throughput, again because the load can
be distributed to multiple machines.

_Shards_ are configured per _collection_ so multiple _shards_ of data form
the _collection_ as a whole. To determine in which _shard_ the data is to
be stored ArangoDB performs a hash across the values. By default this
hash is being created from the document __key_.

For further information, please refer to the
[_Cluster Administration_ ](../../../Administration/Cluster/README.md#sharding) section.

Synchronous replication
-----------------------

In an ArangoDB Cluster, the replication among the data stored by the _DBServers_
is synchronous.

Synchronous replication works on a per-shard basis. Using the option _replicationFactor_,
one configures for each _collection_ how many copies of each _shard_ are kept in the Cluster.

At any given time, one of the copies is declared to be the _leader_ and
all other replicas are _followers_. Write operations for this _shard_
are always sent to the _DBServer_ which happens to hold the _leader_ copy,
which in turn replicates the changes to all _followers_ before the operation
is considered to be done and reported back to the _Coordinator_.
Read operations are all served by the server holding the _leader_ copy,
this allows to provide snapshot semantics for complex transactions.

Using synchronous replication alone will guarantee consistency and high availabilty
at the cost of reduced performance: write requests will have a higher latency
(due to every write-request having to be executed on the followers) and
read requests will not scale out as only the _leader_ is being asked.

In a Cluster, synchronous replication will be managed by the _Coordinators_ for the client. 
The data will always be stored on the _DBServers_.

The following example will give you an idea of how synchronous operation
has been implemented in ArangoDB Cluster:

1. Connect to a coordinator via arangosh
2. Create a collection

    127.0.0.1:8530@_system> db._create("test", {"replicationFactor": 2})

3. the coordinator will figure out a *leader* and 1 *follower* and create 1 *shard* (as this is the default)
4. Insert data

    127.0.0.1:8530@_system> db.test.insert({"replication": "ðŸ˜Ž"})

5. The coordinator will write the data to the leader, which in turn will
replicate it to the follower.
6. Only when both were successful the result is reported to be successful
   ```json
   {
       "_id" : "test/7987",
       "_key" : "7987",
       "_rev" : "7987"
   }
   ```
   When a follower fails, the leader will give up on it after 3 seconds
   and proceed with the operation. As soon as the follower (or the network
   connection to the leader) is back up, the two will resynchronize and
   synchronous replication is resumed. This happens all transparently
   to the client.

Automatic failover
------------------

If a _DBServer_ that holds a _follower_ copy of a _shard_ fails, then the _leader_
can no longer synchronize its changes to that _follower_. After a short timeout
(3 seconds), the _leader_ gives up on the _follower_, declares it to be
out of sync, and continues service without the _follower_. When the server
with the _follower_ copy comes back, it automatically resynchronizes its
data with the _leader_ and synchronous replication is restored.

If a _DBserver_ that holds a _leader_ copy of a shard fails, then the _leader_
can no longer serve any requests. It will no longer send a heartbeat to
the _Agency_. Therefore, a _supervision_ process running in the Raft leader
of the Agency, can take the necessary action (after 15 seconds of missing
heartbeats), namely to promote one of the servers that hold in-sync
replicas of the shard to leader for that shard. This involves a
reconfiguration in the Agency and leads to the fact that coordinators
now contact a different DBserver for requests to this shard. Service
resumes. The other surviving replicas automatically resynchronize their
data with the new leader. When the DBserver with the original leader
copy comes back, it notices that it now holds a follower replica,
resynchronizes its data with the new leader and order is restored.

The following example will give you an idea of how failover
has been implemented in ArangoDB Cluster:

1. The _leader_ of a _shard_ (lets name it _DBServer001_) is going down.
2. A _Coordinator_ is asked to return a document:

    127.0.0.1:8530@_system> db.test.document("100069")

3. The _Coordinator_ determines which server is responsible for this document and finds _DBServer001_
4. The _Coordinator_ tries to contact _DBServer001_ and timeouts because it is not reachable.
5. After a short while the _supervision_ (running in parallel on the _Agency_) will see that _heartbeats_ from _DBServer001_ are not coming in
6. The _supervision_ promotes one of the _followers_ (say _DBServer002_), that is in sync, to be _leader_ and makes _DBServer001_ a _follower_.
7. As the _Coordinator_ continues trying to fetch the document it will see that the _leader_ changed to _DBServer002_
8. The _Coordinator_ tries to contact the new _leader_ (_DBServer002_) and returns the result:

    ```json
    {
        "_key" : "100069",
        "_id" : "test/100069",
        "_rev" : "513",
        "replication" : "ðŸ˜Ž"
    }
    ```
9. After a while the _supervision_ declares _DBServer001_ to be completely dead.
10. A new _follower_ is determined from the pool of _DBservers_.
11. The new _follower_ syncs its data from the _leade_r and order is restored.

Please note that there may still be timeouts. Depending on when exactly
the request has been done (in regard to the _supervision_) and depending
on the time needed to reconfigure the Cluster the _Coordinator_ might fail
with a timeout error!

Shard movement and resynchronization
------------------------------------

All _shard_ data synchronizations are done in an incremental way, such that
resynchronizations are quick. This technology allows to move shards
(_follower_ and _leader_ ones) between _DBServers_ without service interruptions.
Therefore, an ArangoDB Cluster can move all the data on a specific _DBServer_
to other _DBServers_ and then shut down that server in a controlled way.
This allows to scale down an ArangoDB Cluster without service interruption,
loss of fault tolerance or data loss. Furthermore, one can re-balance the
distribution of the _shards_, either manually or automatically.

All these operations can be triggered via a REST/JSON API or via the
graphical web UI. All fail-over operations are completely handled within
the ArangoDB Cluster.

Obviously, synchronous replication involves a certain increased latency for
write operations, simply because there is one more network hop within the
Cluster for every request. Therefore the user can set the _replicationFactor_
to 1, which means that only one copy of each shard is kept, thereby
switching off synchronous replication. This is a suitable setting for
less important or easily recoverable data for which low latency write
operations matter.

Microservices and zero administation
------------------------------------

The design and capabilities of ArangoDB are geared towards usage in
modern microservice architectures of applications. With the
[Foxx services](../../../Foxx/README.md) it is very easy to deploy a data
centric microservice within an ArangoDB Cluster.

In addition, one can deploy multiple instances of ArangoDB within the
same project. One part of the project might need a scalable document
store, another might need a graph database, and yet another might need
the full power of a multi-model database actually mixing the various
data models. There are enormous efficiency benefits to be reaped by
being able to use a single technology for various roles in a project.

To simplify life of the _devops_ in such a scenario we try as much as
possible to use a _zero administration_ approach for ArangoDB. A running
ArangoDB Cluster is resilient against failures and essentially repairs
itself in case of temporary failures. See the next section for further
capabilities in this direction.

Apache Mesos integration
------------------------

For the distributed setup, we use the Apache Mesos infrastructure by default.

ArangoDB is a fully certified package for DC/OS and can thus
be deployed essentially with a few mouse clicks or a single command, once
you have an existing DC/OS cluster. But even on a plain Apache Mesos cluster
one can deploy ArangoDB via Marathon with a single API call and some JSON
configuration.

The advantage of this approach is that we can not only implement the
initial deployment, but also the later management of automatic
replacement of failed instances and the scaling of the ArangoDB cluster
(triggered manually or even automatically). Since all manipulations are
either via the graphical web UI or via JSON/REST calls, one can even
implement auto-scaling very easily.

A DC/OS cluster is a very natural environment to deploy microservice
architectures, since it is so convenient to deploy various services,
including potentially multiple ArangoDB cluster instances within the
same DC/OS cluster. The built-in service discovery makes it extremely
simple to connect the various microservices and Mesos automatically
takes care of the distribution and deployment of the various tasks.

See the [Deployment](../../../Deployment/README.md) chapter and its subsections
for instructions.

It is possible to deploy an ArangoDB cluster by simply launching a bunch of
Docker containers with the right command line options to link them up,
or even on a single machine starting multiple ArangoDB processes. In that
case, synchronous replication will work within the deployed ArangoDB cluster,
and automatic fail-over in the sense that the duties of a failed server will
automatically be assigned to another, surviving one. However, since the
ArangoDB cluster cannot within itself launch additional instances, replacement
of failed nodes is not automatic and scaling up and down has to be managed
manually. This is why we do not recommend this setup for production
deployment.
