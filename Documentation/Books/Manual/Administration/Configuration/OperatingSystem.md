Operating System Configuration
==============================

File Systems
------------

(LINUX)

We recommend to **not** use BTRFS on linux, it's known to not work
well in conjunction with ArangoDB.  We experienced that arangodb
facing latency issues on accessing its database files on BTRFS
partitions.  In conjunction with BTRFS and AUFS we also saw data loss
on restart.


Virtual Memory Page Sizes
--------------------------

(LINUX)

By default, ArangoDB uses Jemalloc as the memory allocator. Jemalloc does a good
job of reducing virtual memory fragmentation, especially for long-running
processes. Unfortunately, some OS configurations can interfere with Jemalloc's
ability to function properly. Specifically, Linux's "transparent hugepages",
Windows' "large pages" and other similar features sometimes prevent Jemalloc
from returning unused memory to the operating system and result in unnecessarily
high memory use. Therefore, we recommend disabling these features when using
Jemalloc with ArangoDB. Please consult your operating system's documentation for
how to do this.

Execute

    sudo bash -c "echo madvise >/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled"
    sudo bash -c "echo madvise >/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag"

before executing `arangod`.

Swap Space
----------

(LINUX)

It is recommended to assign swap space for a server that is running arangod.
Configuring swap space can prevent the operating system's OOM killer from
killing ArangoDB too eagerly on Linux.

### Over-Commit Memory

The recommended kernel setting for `overcommit_memory` for both MMFiles and
RocksDB storage engine is 0 or 1. The kernel default is 0.

You can set it as follows before executing `arangod`:

    sudo bash -c "echo 0 >/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory"

From [www.kernel.org](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt):

- When this flag is 0, the kernel attempts to estimate the amount
  of free memory left when userspace requests more memory.

- When this flag is 1, the kernel pretends there is always enough
  memory until it actually runs out.

- When this flag is 2, the kernel uses a "never overcommit"
  policy that attempts to prevent any overcommit of memory.

### Zone Reclaim

Execute

    sudo bash -c "echo 0 >/proc/sys/vm/zone_reclaim_mode"

before executing `arangod`.

From [www.kernel.org](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt):

This is value ORed together of

- 1 = Zone reclaim on
- 2 = Zone reclaim writes dirty pages out
- 4 = Zone reclaim swaps pages

NUMA
----

Multi-processor systems often have non-uniform Access Memory (NUMA). ArangoDB
should be started with interleave on such system. This can be achieved using

    numactl --interleave=all arangod ...

Max Memory Mappings
-------------------

(LINUX)

Linux kernels by default restrict the maximum number of memory mappings of a
single process to about 64K mappings. While this value is sufficient for most
workloads, it may be too low for a process that has lots of parallel threads
that all require their own memory mappings. In this case all the threads' 
memory mappings will be accounted to the single arangod process, and the 
maximum number of 64K mappings may be reached. When the maximum number of
mappings is reached, calls to mmap will fail, so the process will think no
more memory is available although there may be plenty of RAM left.

To avoid this scenario, it is recommended to raise the default value for the
maximum number of memory mappings to a sufficiently high value. As a rule of
thumb, one could use 8 times the number of available cores times 8,000.

For a 32 core server, a good rule-of-thumb value thus would be 2,048,000 
(32 * 8 * 8000). For certain workloads, it may be sensible to use even a higher
value for the number of memory mappings.

To set the value once, use the following command before starting arangod:

    sudo bash -c "sysctl -w 'vm.max_map_count=2048000'"

To make the settings durable, it will be necessary to store the adjusted 
settings in /etc/sysctl.conf or other places that the operating system is
looking at.

Environment Variables
---------------------

(LINUX)

It is recommended to set the environment variable `GLIBCXX_FORCE_NEW` to 1 on
systems that use glibc++ in order to disable the memory pooling built into
glibc++. That memory pooling is unnecessary because Jemalloc will already do
memory pooling.

Execute

    export GLIBCXX_FORCE_NEW=1


before starting `arangod`.

32bit
-----

While it is possible to compile ArangoDB on 32bit system, this is not a
recommended environment. 64bit systems can address a significantly bigger
memory region.
