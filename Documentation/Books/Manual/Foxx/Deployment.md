# Deployment

Foxx services can be deployed in multiple ways:

- [Foxx CLI](../Programs/FoxxCLI/README.md), a command line tool which
  requires Node.js

- [HTTP API](../../HTTP/Foxx/index.html) using HTTP requests,
  e.g. with curl

- [Web UI](../Programs/WebInterface/Services.md) under *SERVICES*

See [Foxx in a cluster setup](README.md#foxx-in-a-cluster-setup)
for how Foxx services get distributed to coordinators.
