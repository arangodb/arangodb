!CHAPTER Request objects

The request object specifies the following properties:

* **arangoUser**: `string | null`

  The authenticated ArangoDB username used to make the request.
  This value is only set if authentication is enabled in ArangoDB and the request set an `authorization` header ArangoDB was able to verify.
  You are strongly encouraged to implement your own authentication logic for your own services but this property can be useful if you need to integrate with ArangoDB's own authentication mechanisms.

* **arangoVersion**: `number`

  The numeric value of the `x-arango-version` header or the numeric version of the ArangoDB server (e.g. `30102` for version 3.1.2) if no valid header was provided.

* **baseUrl**: `string`

  Root-relative base URL of the service, i.e. the prefix `"/_db/"` followed by the value of *database*.

* **body**: `any`

  The processed and validated request body for the current route.

  For details on how request bodies can be processed and validated by Foxx see the [body method of the endpoint object](Endpoints.md#body).

* **context**: `Context`

  The [service context](../Context.md) in which the router was mounted (rather than the context in which the route was defined).

* **database**: `string`

  The name of the database in which the request is being handled, e.g. `"_system"`.

* **headers**: `object`

  The raw headers object.

  For details on how request headers can be validated by Foxx see the [header method of the endpoint object](Endpoints.md#header).

* **hostname**: `string`

  The hostname (domain name) indicated in the request headers.

  Defaults to the hostname portion (i.e. excluding the port) of the `Host` header and falls back to the listening address of the server.

* **method**: `string`

  The HTTP verb used to make the request, e.g. `"GET"`.

* **originalUrl**: `string`

  Root-relative URL of the request, i.e. *path* followed by the raw query parameters, if any.

* **path**: `string`

  Database-relative path of the request URL (not including the query parameters).

* **pathParams**: `object`

  An object mapping the names of path parameters of the current route to their validated values.

  For details on how path parameters can be validated by Foxx see the [pathParam method of the endpoint object](Endpoints.md#pathparam).

* **port**: `number`

  The port indicated in the request headers.

  Defaults to the port portion (i.e. excluding the hostname) of the `Host` header and falls back to the listening port or the appropriate default port (`443` for HTTPS or `80` for HTTP, depending on *secure*) if the header only indicates a hostname.

  If the request was made using a trusted proxy (see *trustProxy*),
  this is set to the port portion of the `X-Forwarded-Host` header (or approriate default port) if present.

* **protocol**: `string`

  The protocol used for the request.

  Defaults to `"https"` or `"http"` depending on whether ArangoDB is configured to use SSL or not.

  If the request was made using a trusted proxy (see *trustProxy*),
  this is set to the value of the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header if present.

* **queryParams**: `object`

  An object mapping the names of query parameters of the current route to their validated values.

  For details on how query parameters can be validated by Foxx see the [queryParam method of the endpoint object](Endpoints.md#queryparam).

* **rawBody**: `Buffer`

  The raw, unparsed, unvalidated request body as a buffer.

* **remoteAddress**: `string`

  The IP of the client that made the request.

  If the request was made using a trusted proxy (see *trustProxy*),
  this is set to the first IP listed in the `X-Forwarded-For` header if present.

* **remoteAddresses**: `Array<string>`

  A list containing the IP addresses used to make the request.

  Defaults to the value of *remoteAddress* wrapped in an array.

  If the request was made using a trusted proxy (see *trustProxy*),
  this is set to the list of IPs specified in the `X-Forwarded-For` header if present.

* **remotePort**: `number`

  The listening port of the client that made the request.

  If the request was made using a trusted proxy (see *trustProxy*),
  this is set to the port specified in the `X-Forwarded-Port` header if present.

* **secure**: `boolean`

  Whether the request was made over a secure connection (i.e. HTTPS).

  This is set to `false` when *protocol* is `"http"` and `true` when *protocol* is `"https"`.

* **suffix**: `string`

  The trailing path relative to the current route if the current route ends in a wildcard.

* **trustProxy**: `boolean`

  Indicates whether the request was made using a trusted proxy.
  If the origin server's address was specified in the ArangoDB configuration using `--frontend.trusted-proxy` or the service's `trustProxy` setting is enabled, this will be `true`, otherwise it will be `false`.

* **url**: `string`

  The URL of the request.<!-- TODO expand on this -->

* **xhr**: `boolean`

  Whether the request indicates it was made within a browser using AJAX.

  This is set to `true` if the `X-Requested-With` header is present and is a case-insensitive match for the value `"xmlhttprequest"`.

  Note that this value does not guarantee whether the request was made from inside a browser or whether AJAX was used and is merely a convention established by JavaScript frameworks like jQuery.

!SECTION accepts

`req.accepts(types): string | false`

`req.accepts(...types): string | false`

`req.acceptsCharsets(charsets): string | false`

`req.acceptsCharsets(...charsets): string | false`

`req.acceptsEncodings(encodings): string | false`

`req.acceptsEncodings(...encodings): string | false`

`req.acceptsLanguages(languages): string | false`

`req.acceptsLanguages(...languages): string | false`

These methods wrap the corresponding content negotiation methods of the [accepts module](https://github.com/jshttp/accepts) for the current request.

**Examples**

```js
if (req.accepts(['json', 'html']) === 'html') {
  // Client explicitly prefers HTML over JSON
  res.write('<h1>Client prefers HTML</h1>');
} else {
  // Otherwise just send JSON
  res.json({success: true});
}
```

!SECTION cookie

`req.cookie(name, options): string | null`

Gets the value of a cookie by name.

**Arguments**

* **name**: `string`

  Name of the cookie.

* **options**: `object` (optional)

  An object with any of the following properties:

  * **secret**: `string` (optional)

    Secret that was used to sign the cookie.

    If a secret is specified, the cookie's signature is expected to be present in a second cookie with the same name and the suffix `.sig`. Otherwise the signature (if present) will be ignored.

  * **algorithm**: `string` (Default: `"sha256"`)

    Algorithm that was used to sign the cookie.

If a string is passed instead of an options object it will be interpreted as the *secret* option.

Returns the value of the cookie or `null` if the cookie is not set or its signature is invalid.

!SECTION get / header

`req.get(name): string`

`req.header(name): string`

Gets the value of a header by name. You can validate request headers using the [header method of the endpoint](Endpoints.md#header).

**Arguments**

* **name**: `string`

  Name of the header.

Returns the header value.

!SECTION is

`req.is(types): string`

`req.is(...types): string`

This method wraps the (request body) content type detection method of the [type-is module](https://github.com/jshttp/type-is) for the current request.

**Examples**

```js
const type = req.is('html', 'application/xml', 'application/*+xml');
if (type === false) { // no match
  handleDefault(req.rawBody);
} else if (type === 'html') {
  handleHtml(req.rawBody);
} else { // is XML
  handleXml(req.rawBody);
}
```

!SECTION json

`req.json(): any`

Attempts to parse the raw request body as JSON and returns the result.

It is generally more useful to define a [request body on the endpoint](Endpoints.md#body) and use the `req.body` property instead.

Returns `undefined` if the request body is empty. May throw a `SyntaxError` if the body could not be parsed.

!SECTION makeAbsolute

`req.makeAbsolute(path, [query]): string`

Resolves the given path relative to the `req.context.service`'s mount path to a full URL.

**Arguments**

* **path**: `string`

  The path to resovle.

* **query**: `string | object`

  A string or object with query parameters to add to the URL.

Returns the formatted absolute URL.

!SECTION params

`req.param(name): any`

**Arguments**

Looks up a parameter by name, preferring `pathParams` over `queryParams`.

It's probably better style to use the `req.pathParams` or `req.queryParams` objects directly.

* **name**: `string`

  Name of the parameter.

Returns the (validated) value of the parameter.

!SECTION range

`req.range([size]): Ranges | number`

This method wraps the range header parsing method of the [range-parser module](https://github.com/jshttp/range-parser) for the current request.

**Arguments**

* **size**: `number` (Default: `Infinity`)

  Length of the satisfiable range (e.g. number of bytes in the full response). If present, ranges exceeding the size will be considered unsatisfiable.

Returns `undefined` if the `Range` header is absent, `-2` if the header is present but malformed, `-1` if the range is invalid (e.g. start offset is larger than end offset) or unsatisfiable for the given size.

Otherwise returns an array of objects with the properties *start* and *end* values for each range. The array has an additional property *type* indicating the request range type.

**Examples**

```js
console.log(req.headers.range); // "bytes=40-80"
const ranges = req.range(100);
console.log(ranges); // [{start: 40, end: 80}]
console.log(ranges.type); // "bytes"
```

!SECTION reverse

`req.reverse(name, [params]): string`

Looks up the URL of a named route for the given parameters.

**Arguments**

* **name**: `string`

  Name of the route to look up.

* **params**: `object` (optional)

  An object containing values for the (path or query) parameters of the route.

Returns the URL of the route for the given parameters.

**Examples**

```js
router.get('/items/:id', function (req, res) {
  /* ... */
}, 'getItemById');

router.post('/items', function (req, res) {
  // ...
  const url = req.reverse('getItemById', {id: createdItem._key});
  res.set('location', req.makeAbsolute(url));
});
```
