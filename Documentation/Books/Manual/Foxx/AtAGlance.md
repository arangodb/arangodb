!CHAPTER Foxx at a glance

Each Foxx service is defined by a [JSON manifest](Manifest.md) specifying the entry point, any scripts defined by the service, possible configuration options and Foxx dependencies, as well as other metadata. Within a service, these options are exposed as the [service context](Context.md).

At the heart of the Foxx framework lies the [Foxx Router](Router/README.md) which is used to define HTTP endpoints. A service can access the database either directly from its context using prefixed collections or the [ArangoDB database API](Modules.md).

While Foxx is primarily designed to be used to access the database itself, ArangoDB also provides an [API to make HTTP requests](Modules.md) to external services.

Finally, [scripts](Scripts.md) can be used to perform one-off tasks, which can also be scheduled to be performed asynchronously using the built-in job queue.

!SECTION How does it work

Foxx services consist of JavaScript code running in the V8 JavaScript runtime embedded inside ArangoDB. Each service is mounted in each available V8 context (the number of contexts can be adjusted in the ArangoDB configuration). Incoming requests are distributed accross these contexts automatically.

If you're coming from another JavaScript environment like Node.js this is similar to running multiple Node.js processes behind a load balancer: you should not rely on server-side state (other than the database itself) between different requests as there is no way of making sure consecutive requests will be handled in the same context.

Because the JavaScript code is running inside the database another difference is that all Foxx and ArangoDB APIs are purely synchronous and should be considered blocking. This is especially important for transactions, which in ArangoDB can execute arbitrary code but may have to lock entire collections (effectively preventing any data to be written) until the code has completed.

For information on how this affects interoperability with third-party JavaScript modules written for other JavaScript environments see [the chapter on dependencies](./Dependencies.md).

!SECTION Development mode

Development mode allows you to make changes to deployed services in-place directly on the database server's file system without downloading and re-uploading the service bundle.

You can toggle development mode on and off in the service settings tab of the web interface. Once activated the service's file system path will be shown in the info tab.

Once enabled the service's source files and manifest will be re-evaluated every time a route of the service is accessed, effectively re-deploying the service on every request. As the name indicates this is intended to be used strictly during development and is most definitely a bad idea on production servers.

Also note that if you are serving static files as part of your service, accessing these files from a browser may also trigger a re-deployment of the service. Finally, making HTTP requests to a service running in development mode from within the service (i.e. using the `@arangodb/request` module to access the service itself) is probably not a good idea either.

Beware of deleting the database the service is deployed on: it will erase the source files of the service along with the collections. You should backup the code you worked on in development before doing that to avoid losing your progress.

!SECTION Foxx store

The Foxx store provides access to a number of ready-to-use official and community-maintained Foxx services you can install with a single click, including example services and wrappers for external SaaS tools like transactional e-mail services, bug loggers or analytics trackers.

You can find the Foxx store in the web interface by using the *Add Service* button in the service list.

!SECTION Cluster-Foxx

When running ArangoDB in a cluster the Foxx services will run on each coordinator. Installing, upgrading and uninstalling services on any coordinator will automatically affect the other coordinators, making deployments as easy as in single-server mode. However, this means there are some limitations:

You should avoid any kind of file system state beyond the deployed service bundle itself. Don't write data to the file system or encode any expectations of the file system state other than the files in the service folder that were installed as part of the service (e.g. file uploads or custom log files).

Additionally, the development mode is not supported in cluster mode. The development mode is intended to allow modifying the service's code and seeing the effect of those changes in realtime. The service is automatically deployed to multiple coordinators, but with (temporarily) different copies of the service, the inconsistent state would lead to unpredictable behavior. It is recommended that you either re-deploy services when making changes to code running in a cluster or use development mode on a single-server installation.
