Single Instance Deployment
==========================

Unlike other setups, like the _Active Failover_, _Cluster_, or _Multiple Datacenters_,
which require some specific procedure to be started once the ArangoDB package has
been installed, deploying a single-instance is straightforward.

Depending on your operating system, after the installation the ArangoDB Server
might be already up and running. _Start_, _stop_ and _restart_ operations can be
handled directly using your _System and Service Manager_.

The following are two additional ways that can be used to start the stand-alone
instance:

1. Using the [_ArangoDB Starter_](UsingTheStarter.md), or 
2. [manually](ManualStart.md).
