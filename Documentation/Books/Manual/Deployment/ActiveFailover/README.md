Active Failover Deployment
==========================

This _Section_ describes how to deploy an _Active Failover_ environment.

For a general introduction to _Active Failover_, please refer to the
[Active Failover](../../Architecture/DeploymentModes/ActiveFailover/README.md) chapter.

There are two main ways to start an _Active Failover_ setup:

1. using the [_ArangoDB Starter_](UsingTheStarter.md) (possibly in conjunction with
docker), or
1. [manually](ManualStart.md).
