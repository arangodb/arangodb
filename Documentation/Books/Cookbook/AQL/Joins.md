Using Joins in AQL
==================

Problem
-------

I want to join documents from collections in an AQL query.

- One-to-Many: I have a collection users and a collection cities. A user lives in a city and I need the city information during the query.

- Many-To-Many: I have a collection authors and books. An author can write many
  books and a book can have many authors. I want to return a list of books with
  their authors. Therefore I need to join the authors and books.

Solution
--------

Unlike many NoSQL databases, ArangoDB does support joins in AQL queries. This is
similar to the way traditional relational databases handle this. However,
because documents allow for more flexibility, joins are also more flexible. The
following sections provide solutions for common questions.

### One-To-Many

You have a collection called users. Users live in city and a city is identified
by its primary key. In principle you can embedded the city document into the users
document and be happy with it.

```json
{ 
  "_id" : "users/2151975421", 
  "_key" : "2151975421", 
  "_rev" : "2151975421", 
  "name" : { 
    "first" : "John", 
    "last" : "Doe" 
  }, 
  "city" : { 
    "name" : "Metropolis" 
  } 
}
```

This works well for many use cases. Now assume, that you have additional
information about the city, like the number of people living in it. It would be
impractical to change each and every user document if this numbers
changes. Therefore it is good idea to hold the city information in a separate
collection.

```json
arangosh> db.cities.document("cities/2241300989");
{ 
  "population" : 1000, 
  "name" : "Metropolis", 
  "_id" : "cities/2241300989", 
  "_rev" : "2241300989", 
  "_key" : "2241300989" 
}
```

Now you instead of embedding the city directly in the user document, you can use
the key of the city.

```json
arangosh> db.users.document("users/2290649597");
{ 
  "name" : { 
    "first" : "John", 
    "last" : "Doe" 
  }, 
  "city" : "cities/2241300989", 
  "_id" : "users/2290649597", 
  "_rev" : "2290649597", 
  "_key" : "2290649597" 
}
```

We can now join these two collections very easily.

```json
arangosh> db._query(
........>"FOR u IN users " + 
........>"  FOR c IN cities " + 
........>"    FILTER u.city == c._id RETURN { user: u, city: c }"
........>).toArray()
[ 
  { 
    "user" : { 
      "name" : { 
        "first" : "John", 
        "last" : "Doe" 
      }, 
      "city" : "cities/2241300989", 
      "_id" : "users/2290649597", 
      "_rev" : "2290649597", 
      "_key" : "2290649597" 
    }, 
    "city" : { 
      "population" : 1000, 
      "name" : "Metropolis", 
      "_id" : "cities/2241300989", 
      "_rev" : "2241300989", 
      "_key" : "2241300989" 
    } 
  } 
]
```

Unlike SQL there is no special JOIN keyword. The optimizer ensures that the
primary index is used in the above query.

However, very often it is much more convenient for the client of the query if a
single document would be returned, where the city information is embedded in the
user document - as in the simple example above.  With AQL there you do not need
to forgo this simplification.

```json
arangosh> db._query(
........>"FOR u IN users " + 
........>"  FOR c IN cities " + 
........>"    FILTER u.city == c._id RETURN merge(u, {city: c})"
........>).toArray()
[ 
  { 
    "_id" : "users/2290649597", 
    "_key" : "2290649597", 
    "_rev" : "2290649597", 
    "name" : { 
      "first" : "John", 
      "last" : "Doe" 
    }, 
    "city" : { 
      "_id" : "cities/2241300989", 
      "_key" : "2241300989", 
      "_rev" : "2241300989", 
      "population" : 1000, 
      "name" : "Metropolis" 
    } 
  } 
]
```

So you can have both: the convenient representation of the result for your client
and the flexibility of joins for your data model.

### Many-To-Many

In the relational word you need a third table to model the many-to-many
relation. In ArangoDB you have a choice depending on the information you are
going to store and the type of questions you are going to ask.

Assume that authors are stored in one collection and books in a second. If all
you need is "which are the authors of a book" then you can
easily model this as a list attribute in users.

If you want to store more information, for example which author wrote which page in a conference proceeding, or if you also want to know "which books were written by which author", you can use edge collections. This is very similar to the "join table" from the relational world.

#### Embedded Lists

If you only want to store the authors of a book, you can embed them as list in the book document.  There is no need for a separate collection.

```json
arangosh> db.authors.toArray()
[ 
  { 
    "_id" : "authors/2661190141", 
    "_key" : "2661190141", 
    "_rev" : "2661190141", 
    "name" : { 
      "first" : "Maxima", 
      "last" : "Musterfrau" 
    } 
  }, 
  { 
    "_id" : "authors/2658437629", 
    "_key" : "2658437629", 
    "_rev" : "2658437629", 
    "name" : { 
      "first" : "John", 
      "last" : "Doe" 
    } 
  } 
]
```

You can query books

```json
arangosh> db._query("FOR b IN books RETURN b").toArray();
[ 
  { 
    "_id" : "books/2681506301", 
    "_key" : "2681506301", 
    "_rev" : "2681506301", 
    "title" : "The beauty of JOINS", 
    "authors" : [ 
      "authors/2661190141", 
      "authors/2658437629" 
    ] 
  } 
]
```

and join the authors in a very similar manner given in the one-to-many section.

```json
arangosh> db._query(
........>"FOR b IN books " +
........>"  LET a = (FOR x IN b.authors " + 
........>"             FOR a IN authors FILTER x == a._id RETURN a) " +
........>"   RETURN { book: b, authors: a }"
........>).toArray();
[ 
  { 
    "book" : { 
      "title" : "The beauty of JOINS", 
      "authors" : [ 
        "authors/2661190141", 
        "authors/2658437629" 
      ], 
      "_id" : "books/2681506301", 
      "_rev" : "2681506301", 
      "_key" : "2681506301" 
    }, 
    "authors" : [ 
      { 
        "name" : { 
          "first" : "Maxima", 
          "last" : "Musterfrau" 
        }, 
        "_id" : "authors/2661190141", 
        "_rev" : "2661190141", 
        "_key" : "2661190141" 
      }, 
      { 
        "name" : { 
          "first" : "John", 
          "last" : "Doe" 
        }, 
        "_id" : "authors/2658437629", 
        "_rev" : "2658437629", 
        "_key" : "2658437629" 
      } 
    ] 
  } 
]
```

or embed the authors directly

```json
arangosh> db._query(
........>"FOR b IN books LET a = (" + 
........>"     FOR x IN b.authors " + 
........>"        FOR a IN authors FILTER x == a._id RETURN a)" +
........>"  RETURN merge(b, { authors: a })"
........>).toArray();
[ 
  { 
    "_id" : "books/2681506301", 
    "_key" : "2681506301", 
    "_rev" : "2681506301", 
    "title" : "The beauty of JOINS", 
    "authors" : [ 
      { 
        "_id" : "authors/2661190141", 
        "_key" : "2661190141", 
        "_rev" : "2661190141", 
        "name" : { 
          "first" : "Maxima", 
          "last" : "Musterfrau" 
        } 
      }, 
      { 
        "_id" : "authors/2658437629", 
        "_key" : "2658437629", 
        "_rev" : "2658437629", 
        "name" : { 
          "first" : "John", 
          "last" : "Doe" 
        } 
      } 
    ] 
  } 
]
```

#### Using Edge Collections

If you also want to query which books are written by a given author, embedding authors
in the book document is possible, but it is more efficient to use a edge collections for
speed.

Or you are publishing a proceeding, then you want to store the pages the author has written
as well. This information can be stored in the edge document.

First create the users

```json
arangosh> db._create("authors");
[ArangoCollection 2926807549, "authors" (type document, status loaded)]

arangosh> db.authors.save({ name: { first: "John", last: "Doe" } })
{ 
  "error" : false, 
  "_id" : "authors/2935261693", 
  "_rev" : "2935261693", 
  "_key" : "2935261693" 
}

arangosh> db.authors.save({ name: { first: "Maxima", last: "Musterfrau" } })
{ 
  "error" : false, 
  "_id" : "authors/2938210813", 
  "_rev" : "2938210813", 
  "_key" : "2938210813" 
}
```

Now create the books without any author information.

```json
arangosh> db._create("books");
[ArangoCollection 2928380413, "books" (type document, status loaded)]

arangosh> db.books.save({ title: "The beauty of JOINS" });
{ 
  "error" : false, 
  "_id" : "books/2980088317", 
  "_rev" : "2980088317", 
  "_key" : "2980088317" 
}
```

An edge collection is now used to link authors and books.

```json
arangosh> db._createEdgeCollection("written");
[ArangoCollection 2931132925, "written" (type edge, status loaded)]

arangosh> db.written.save("authors/2935261693",
........>"books/2980088317",
........>{ pages: "1-10" })
{ 
  "error" : false, 
  "_id" : "written/3006237181", 
  "_rev" : "3006237181", 
  "_key" : "3006237181" 
}

arangosh> db.written.save("authors/2938210813",
........>"books/2980088317",
........>{ pages: "11-20" })
{ 
  "error" : false, 
  "_id" : "written/3012856317", 
  "_rev" : "3012856317", 
  "_key" : "3012856317" 
}
```

In order to get all books with their authors you can use NEIGHBORS.

```json
arangosh> db._query(
........>"FOR b IN books RETURN " + 
........>"  { " +
........>"    book: b, " +
........>"    authors: NEIGHBORS(books," + 
........>"                       written," + 
........>"                       b._id," + 
........>"                      'inbound'" +
........>" ) }"
........>).toArray();
[ 
  { 
    "book" : { 
      "_id" : "books/2980088317", 
      "_rev" : "2980088317", 
      "_key" : "2980088317", 
      "title" : "The beauty of JOINS" 
    }, 
    "authors" : [ 
      { 
        "edge" : { 
          "_id" : "written/3006237181", 
          "_from" : "authors/2935261693", 
          "_to" : "books/2980088317", 
          "_rev" : "3006237181", 
          "_key" : "3006237181", 
          "pages" : "1-10" 
        }, 
        "vertex" : { 
          "_id" : "authors/2935261693", 
          "_rev" : "2935261693", 
          "_key" : "2935261693", 
          "name" : { 
            "first" : "John", 
            "last" : "Doe" 
          } 
        } 
      }, 
      { 
        "edge" : { 
          "_id" : "written/3012856317", 
          "_from" : "authors/2938210813", 
          "_to" : "books/2980088317", 
          "_rev" : "3012856317", 
          "_key" : "3012856317", 
          "pages" : "11-20" 
        }, 
        "vertex" : { 
          "_id" : "authors/2938210813", 
          "_rev" : "2938210813", 
          "_key" : "2938210813", 
          "name" : { 
            "first" : "Maxima", 
            "last" : "Musterfrau" 
          } 
        } 
      } 
    ] 
  } 
]
```

Or if you want to hide the information stored in the edge.

```json
arangosh> db._query(
........>"FOR b IN books RETURN {" +
........>"     book: b, authors: " +
........>"          NEIGHBORS(books, written, b._id, 'inbound')[*].vertex }"
........>).toArray();
[ 
  { 
    "book" : { 
      "title" : "The beauty of JOINS", 
      "_id" : "books/2980088317", 
      "_rev" : "2980088317", 
      "_key" : "2980088317" 
    }, 
    "authors" : [ 
      { 
        "_id" : "authors/2935261693", 
        "_rev" : "2935261693", 
        "_key" : "2935261693", 
        "name" : { 
          "first" : "John", 
          "last" : "Doe" 
        } 
      }, 
      { 
        "_id" : "authors/2938210813", 
        "_rev" : "2938210813", 
        "_key" : "2938210813", 
        "name" : { 
          "first" : "Maxima", 
          "last" : "Musterfrau" 
        } 
      } 
    ] 
  } 
]
```

Or again embed the authors directly into the book document.

```json
arangosh> db._query(
........>"FOR b IN books RETURN merge(" +
........>"      b, " +
........>"        {" +
........>"          authors:" +
........>"          NEIGHBORS(books, written, b._id, 'inbound')[*].vertex})"
........>).toArray();
[ 
  { 
    "_id" : "books/2980088317", 
    "_rev" : "2980088317", 
    "_key" : "2980088317", 
    "title" : "The beauty of JOINS", 
    "authors" : [ 
      { 
        "_id" : "authors/2935261693", 
        "_rev" : "2935261693", 
        "_key" : "2935261693", 
        "name" : { 
          "first" : "John", 
          "last" : "Doe" 
        } 
      }, 
      { 
        "_id" : "authors/2938210813", 
        "_rev" : "2938210813", 
        "_key" : "2938210813", 
        "name" : { 
          "first" : "Maxima", 
          "last" : "Musterfrau" 
        } 
      } 
    ] 
  } 
]
```

If you need the authors and their books, simply reverse the direction.

```json
arangosh> db._query(
........>"FOR a IN authors RETURN " +
........>"  merge(a, " +
........>"        {books: NEIGHBORS(authors, written, a._id, 'outbound')[*].vertex})"
........>).toArray();
[ 
  { 
    "_id" : "authors/2938210813", 
    "_rev" : "2938210813", 
    "_key" : "2938210813", 
    "name" : { 
      "first" : "Maxima", 
      "last" : "Musterfrau" 
    }, 
    "books" : [ 
      { 
        "_id" : "books/2980088317", 
        "_rev" : "2980088317", 
        "_key" : "2980088317", 
        "title" : "The beauty of JOINS" 
      } 
    ] 
  }, 
  { 
    "_id" : "authors/2935261693", 
    "_rev" : "2935261693", 
    "_key" : "2935261693", 
    "name" : { 
      "first" : "John", 
      "last" : "Doe" 
    }, 
    "books" : [ 
      { 
        "_id" : "books/2980088317", 
        "_rev" : "2980088317", 
        "_key" : "2980088317", 
        "title" : "The beauty of JOINS" 
      } 
    ] 
  } 
]
```
