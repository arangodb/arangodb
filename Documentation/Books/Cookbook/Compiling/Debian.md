Compiling on Debian
===================

Problem
-------

You want to compile and run the devel branch, for example to test a bug fix. In this example the system is Debian based.

Solution
--------

This solution was made using a fresh Debian Testing machine on Amazon EC2. For completeness, the steps pertaining to AWS are also included in this recipe.

### Launch the VM

*Optional*

Login to your AWS account and launch an instance of Debian Testing. I used an 'm3.xlarge' since that has a bunch of cores, more than enough memory, optimized network and the instance store is on SSDs which can be switched to provisioned IOPs.

The Current AMI ID's can be found in the Debian Wiki: https://wiki.debian.org/Cloud/AmazonEC2Image/Jessie

### Upgrade to the very latest version

*Optional*

Once your EC2 instance is up, login ad `admin` and `sudo su` to become `root`.

First, we remove the backports and change the primary sources.list

```bash
rm -rf /etc/apt/sources.list.d
echo "deb     http://http.debian.net/debian testing main contrib"  > /etc/apt/sources.list
echo "deb-src http://http.debian.net/debian testing main contrib" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
```

Update and upgrade the system. Make sure you don't have any broken/unconfigured packages. Sometimes you need to run safe/full upgrade more than once. When you're done, reboot.

```bash
apt-get install aptitude
aptitude -y update
aptitude -y safe-upgrade
aptitude -y full-upgrade
reboot
```

### Install build dependencies

*Mandatory*

Before you can build ArangoDB, you need a few packages pre-installed on your system.

Login again and install them.

```bash
sudo aptitude -y install git-core \
    build-essential \
    libssl-dev \
    libjemalloc-dev \
    cmake \
    python2.7 \
sudo aptitude -y install libldap2-dev # Enterprise Edition only
```

### 
Download the Source

Download the latest source using ***git***:
    
    unix> git clone git://github.com/arangodb/arangodb.git

This will automatically clone the **devel** branch.

Note: if you only plan to compile ArangoDB locally and do not want to modify or push
any changes, you can speed up cloning substantially by using the *--single-branch* and 
*--depth* parameters for the clone command as follows:
    
    unix> git clone --single-branch --depth 1 git://github.com/arangodb/arangodb.git

### Setup

Switch into the ArangoDB directory

    unix> cd arangodb
    unix> mkdir build
    unix> cd build

In order to generate the build environment please execute

    unix> cmake .. 

to setup the Makefiles. This will check the various system characteristics and
installed libraries. If you installed the compiler in a non standard location, you may need to specify it:

    cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/opt/bin/gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/opt/bin/g++ ..

If you compile on macOS, you should add the following options to the cmake command:

    cmake .. -DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=/usr/local/opt/openssl -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.11

If you also plan to make changes to the source code of ArangoDB, you may want to compile with the 
`Debug` build type:
    
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

The `Debug` target enables additional sanity checks etc. which would slow down production 
binaries. If no build type is specified, ArangoDB will be compiled with build type `RelWithDebInfo`,
which is a compromise between good performance and medium debugging experience.

Other options valuable for development:

    -DUSE_MAINTAINER_MODE=On

Needed if you plan to make changes to AQL language (which is implemented using a lexer and parser
files in `arangod/Aql/grammar.y` and `arangod/Aql/tokens.ll`) or if you want to enable runtime
assertions. To use the maintainer mode, your system has to contain the tools FLEX and BISON.

    -DUSE_BACKTRACE=On

Use this option if you want to have C++ stacktraces attached to your exceptions. This can be useful 
to more quickly locate the place where an exception or an assertion was thrown. Note that this
option will slow down the produces binaries a bit and requires building with maintainer mode.

    -DUSE_OPTIMIZE_FOR_ARCHITECTURE=On

This will optimize the binary for the target architecture, potentially enabling more compiler
optimizations, but making the resulting binary less portable.

ArangoDB will then automatically use the configuration from file *etc/relative/arangod.conf*.

    -DUSE_FAILURE_TESTS=On

This option activates additional code in the server that intentionally makes the
server crash or misbehave (e.g. by pretending the system ran out of memory) when certain tests
are run. This option is useful for writing tests.

    -DUSE_JEMALLOC=Off

By default ArangoDB will be built with a bundled version of the JEMalloc allocator. This 
however will not work when using runtime analyzers such as ASAN or Valgrind. In order to use
these tools for instrumenting an ArangoDB binary, JEMalloc must be turned off during compilation.

### shared memory
Gyp is used as makefile generator by V8. Gyp requires shared memory to be available,
which may not if you i.e. compile in a chroot. You can make it available like this:

    none /opt/chroots/ubuntu_precise_x64/dev/shm tmpfs rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec 0 2
    devpts    /opt/chroots/ubuntu_precise_x64/dev/pts    devpts    gid=5,mode=620    0  0


### Compilation

Compile the programs (server, client, utilities) by executing

    make

in the build subdirectory. This will compile ArangoDB and create the binary executable
in file `build/bin/arangod`.

### Starting and testing

Check the binary by starting it using the command line.

    unix> build/bin/arangod -c etc/relative/arangod.conf --server.endpoint tcp://127.0.0.1:8529 /tmp/database-dir

This will start up the ArangoDB and listen for HTTP requests on port 8529 bound
to IP address 127.0.0.1. You should see the startup messages similar to the
following:

```
2016-06-01T12:47:29Z [29266] INFO ArangoDB xxx ... 
2016-06-10T12:47:29Z [29266] INFO using endpoint 'tcp://127.0.0.1.8529' for non-encrypted requests
2016-06-01T12:47:30Z [29266] INFO Authentication is turned on
2016-60-01T12:47:30Z [29266] INFO ArangoDB (version xxx) is ready for business. Have fun!
```

If it fails with a message about the database directory, please make sure the
database directory you specified exists and can be written into.

Use your favorite browser to access the URL

    http://127.0.0.1:8529/

This should bring up ArangoDB's web interface.

### Re-building ArangoDB after an update

To stay up-to-date with changes made in the main ArangoDB repository, you will
need to pull the changes from it and re-run `make`.

Normally, this will be as simple as follows:

    unix> git pull
    unix> (cd build && make)

From time to time there will be bigger structural changes in ArangoDB, which may
render the old Makefiles invalid. Should this be the case and `make` complains
about missing files etc., the following commands should fix it:


    unix> rm -rf build/* 
    unix> cd build && cmake .. <cmake options go here>
    unix> (cd build && make)

Note that the above commands will run a full rebuild of ArangoDB and all
of its third-party components. That will take a while to complete.

### Installation

In a local development environment it is not necessary to install ArangoDB
somewhere, because it can be started from within the source directory as
shown above.

If there should be the need to install ArangoDB, execute the following command:

    (cd build && sudo make install)

The server will by default be installed in

    /usr/local/sbin/arangod

The configuration file will be installed in

    /usr/local/etc/arangodb3/arangod.conf

The database will be installed in

    /usr/local/var/lib/arangodb3

The ArangoShell will be installed in

    /usr/local/bin/arangosh

You should add an arangodb user and group (as root), plus make sure it owns these directories:

    useradd -g arangodb arangodb
    chown -R arangodb:arangodb /usr/local/var/lib/arangodb3-apps/
    chown -R arangodb:arangodb /tmp/database-dir/

**Note:** The installation directory will be different if you use one of the
`precompiled` packages. Please check the default locations of your operating
system, e. g. `/etc` and `/var/lib`.

When upgrading from a previous version of ArangoDB, please make sure you inspect
ArangoDB's log file after an upgrade. It may also be necessary to start ArangoDB
with the *--database.auto-upgrade* parameter once to perform required upgrade or
initialization tasks.
