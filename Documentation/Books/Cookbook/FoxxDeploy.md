# Foxx app deployment

## Problem

I have developed a Foxx App locally using the development mode, now I want to deploy it.

## Solution

Go to the folder that contains your Foxx app and zip it. Go to the web interface of the ArangoDB instance where you want to deploy the app to. Go to the "Applications" tab and then click on "Add Application". Click on the ZIP tab and upload your ZIP file.

You will be prompted to enter the mount path of your app. After entering the mount path, your app will be deployed.
