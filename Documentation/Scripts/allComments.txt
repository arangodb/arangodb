@startDocuBlock collectionGeo

@brief constructs a geo index selection
`collection.geo(location-attribute)`

Looks up a geo index defined on attribute *location_attribute*.

Returns a geo index object if an index was found. The `near` or
`within` operators can then be used to execute a geo-spatial query on
this particular index.

This is useful for collections with multiple defined geo indexes.

`collection.geo(location_attribute, true)`

Looks up a geo index on a compound attribute *location_attribute*.

Returns a geo index object if an index was found. The `near` or
`within` operators can then be used to execute a geo-spatial query on
this particular index.

`collection.geo(latitude_attribute, longitude_attribute)`

Looks up a geo index defined on the two attributes *latitude_attribute*
and *longitude-attribute*.

Returns a geo index object if an index was found. The `near` or
`within` operators can then be used to execute a geo-spatial query on
this particular index.

**Note**: this method is not yet supported by the RocksDB storage engine.

Note: the *geo* simple query helper function is **deprecated** as of ArangoDB
2.6. The function may be removed in future versions of ArangoDB. The preferred
way for running geo queries is to use their AQL equivalents.

@EXAMPLES

Assume you have a location stored as list in the attribute *home*
and a destination stored in the attribute *work*. Then you can use the
`geo` operator to select which geo-spatial attributes (and thus which
index) to use in a `near` query.

<!-- filename: /work/ArangoDB/Documentation/DocuBlocks/WalLogfileAllowOversizeEntries.md -->
@startDocuBlock WalLogfileAllowOversizeEntries

@brief whether or not oversize entries are allowed
`--wal.allow-oversize-entries`

Whether or not it is allowed to store individual documents that are bigger
than would fit into a single logfile. Setting the option to false will
make
such operations fail with an error. Setting the option to true will make
such operations succeed, but with a high potential performance impact.
The reason is that for each oversize operation, an individual oversize
logfile needs to be created which may also block other operations.
The option should be set to *false* if it is certain that documents will
always have a size smaller than a single logfile.
@endDocuBlock


<!-- filename: /work/ArangoDB/Documentation/DocuBlocks/databaseMaximalJournalSize.md -->
@startDocuBlock databaseMaximalJournalSize


`--database.maximal-journal-size size`

Maximal size of journal in bytes. Can be overwritten when creating a new
collection. Note that this also limits the maximal size of a single
document.

The default is *32MB*.
@endDocuBlock


<!-- filename: /work/ArangoDB/Documentation/DocuBlocks/server_authentication.md -->
@startDocuBlock server_authentication

`--server.authentication`

Setting this option to *false* will turn off authentication on the server side
so all clients can execute any action without authorization and privilege
checks.

The default value is *true*.
@endDocuBlock


<!-- filename: /work/ArangoDB/Documentation/DocuBlocks/serverAuthenticateSystemOnly.md -->
@startDocuBlock serverAuthenticateSystemOnly

`--server.authentication-system-only boolean`

Controls whether incoming requests need authentication only if they are
directed to the ArangoDB's internal APIs and features, located at
*/_api/*,
*/_admin/* etc.

If the flag is set to *true*, then HTTP authentication is only
required for requests going to URLs starting with */_*, but not for other
URLs. The flag can thus be used to expose a user-made API without HTTP
authentication to the outside world, but to prevent the outside world from
using the ArangoDB API and the admin interface without authentication.
Note that checking the URL is performed after any database name prefix
has been removed. That means when the actual URL called is
*/_db/_system/myapp/myaction*, the URL */myapp/myaction* will be used for
*authentication-system-only* check.

The default is *true*.

Note that authentication still needs to be enabled for the server regularly 
in order for HTTP authentication to be forced for the ArangoDB API and the
web interface.  Setting only this flag is not enough.

You can control ArangoDB's general authentication feature with the
*--server.authentication* flag.
@endDocuBlock


<!-- filename: /work/ArangoDB/Documentation/DocuBlocks/documentRevision.md -->
@startDocuBlock documentRevision


Every document in ArangoDB has a revision, stored in the system attribute
`_rev`. It is fully managed by the server and read-only for the user.

Its value should be treated as opaque, no guarantees regarding its format
and properties are given except that it will be different after a
document update. More specifically, `_rev` values are unique across all
documents and all collections in a single server setup. In a cluster setup,
within one shard it is guaranteed that two different document revisions
have a different `_rev` string, even if they are written in the same
millisecond.

The `_rev` attribute can be used as a pre-condition for queries, to avoid
_lost update_ situations. That is, if a client fetches a document from the server,
modifies it locally (but with the `_rev` attribute untouched) and sends it back
to the server to update the document, but meanwhile the document was changed by
another operation, then the revisions do not match anymore and the operation
is cancelled by the server. Without this mechanism, the client would
accidentally overwrite changes made to the document without knowing about it.

When an existing document is updated or replaced, ArangoDB will write a new
version of this document to the write-ahead logfile (regardless of the
storage engine). When the new version of the document has been written, the
old version(s) will still be present, at least on disk. The same is true when
an existing document (version) gets removed: the old version of the document
plus the removal operation will be on disk for some time.

On disk it is therefore possible that multiple revisions of the same document
(as identified by the same `_key` value) exist at the same time. However,
stale revisions **are not accessible**. Once a document was updated or removed
successfully, no query or other data retrieval operation done by the user
will be able to see it any more. Furthermore, after some time, old revisions
will be removed internally. This is to avoid ever-growing disk usage.

{% hint 'warning' %}
From a **user perspective**, there is just **one single document revision
present per different `_key`** at every point in time. There is no built-in
system to automatically keep a history of all changes done to a document
and old versions of a document can not be restored via the `_rev` value.
{% endhint %}

<!-- filename: /work/ArangoDB/Documentation/DocuBlocks/WalLogfileSyncInterval.md -->
@startDocuBlock WalLogfileSyncInterval

@brief interval for automatic, non-requested disk syncs
`--wal.sync-interval`

The interval (in milliseconds) that ArangoDB will use to automatically
synchronize data in its write-ahead logs to disk. Automatic syncs will
only be performed for not-yet synchronized data, and only for operations 
that have been executed without the *waitForSync* attribute.
@endDocuBlock


<!-- filename: /work/ArangoDB/Documentation/DocuBlocks/WalLogfileFlushTimeout.md -->
@startDocuBlock WalLogfileFlushTimeout

@brief WAL flush timeout
`--wal.flush-timeout

The timeout (in milliseconds) that ArangoDB will at most wait when flushing
a full WAL logfile to disk. When the timeout is reached and the flush is
not completed, the operation that requested the flush will fail with a 
*lock timeout* error.
@endDocuBlock


<!-- filename: /work/ArangoDB/Documentation/DocuBlocks/collectionNear.md -->
@startDocuBlock collectionNear

@brief constructs a near query for a collection
`collection.near(latitude, longitude)`

The returned list is sorted according to the distance, with the nearest
document to the coordinate (*latitude*, *longitude*) coming first.
If there are near documents of equal distance, documents are chosen randomly
from this set until the limit is reached. It is possible to change the limit
using the *limit* operator.

In order to use the *near* operator, a geo index must be defined for the
collection. This index also defines which attribute holds the coordinates
for the document.  If you have more then one geo-spatial index, you can use
the *geo* operator to select a particular index.

*Note*: `near` does not support negative skips.
//     However, you can still use `limit` followed to skip.

`collection.near(latitude, longitude).limit(limit)`

Limits the result to limit documents instead of the default 100.

*Note*: Unlike with multiple explicit limits, `limit` will raise
the implicit default limit imposed by `within`.

`collection.near(latitude, longitude).distance()`

This will add an attribute `distance` to all documents returned, which
contains the distance between the given point and the document in meters.

`collection.near(latitude, longitude).distance(name)`

This will add an attribute *name* to all documents returned, which
contains the distance between the given point and the document in meters.

**Note**: this method is not yet supported by the RocksDB storage engine.

Note: the *near* simple query function is **deprecated** as of ArangoDB 2.6.
The function may be removed in future versions of ArangoDB. The preferred
way for retrieving documents from a collection using the near operator is
to use the AQL *NEAR* function in an AQL query as follows:

```js
FOR doc IN NEAR(@@collection, @latitude, @longitude, @limit)
    RETURN doc
```

<!-- filename: /work/ArangoDB/Documentation/DocuBlocks/foxxQueuesPollInterval.md -->
@startDocuBlock foxxQueuesPollInterval

@brief poll interval for Foxx queues
`--foxx.queues-poll-interval value`

The poll interval for the Foxx queues manager. The value is specified in
seconds. Lower values will mean more immediate and more frequent Foxx
queue job execution, but will make the queue thread wake up and query the
queues more often. When set to a low value, the queue thread might cause
CPU load.

The default is *1* second. If Foxx queues are not used much, then this
value may be increased to make the queues thread wake up less.

<!-- filename: /work/ArangoDB/Documentation/DocuBlocks/WalLogfileHistoricLogfiles.md -->
@startDocuBlock WalLogfileHistoricLogfiles

@brief maximum number of historic logfiles
`--wal.historic-logfiles`

The maximum number of historic logfiles that ArangoDB will keep after they
have been garbage-collected. If no replication is used, there is no need
to keep historic logfiles except for having a local changelog.

In a replication setup, the number of historic logfiles affects the amount
of data a slave can fetch from the master's logs. The more historic
logfiles, the more historic data is available for a slave, which is useful
if the connection between master and slave is unstable or slow. Not having
enough historic logfiles available might lead to logfile data being
deleted
on the master already before a slave has fetched it.

<!-- filename: /work/ArangoDB/Documentation/DocuBlocks/WalLogfileReserveLogfiles.md -->
@startDocuBlock WalLogfileReserveLogfiles

@brief maximum number of reserve logfiles
`--wal.reserve-logfiles`

The maximum number of reserve logfiles that ArangoDB will create in a
background process. Reserve logfiles are useful in the situation when an
operation needs to be written to a logfile but the reserve space in the
logfile is too low for storing the operation. In this case, a new logfile
needs to be created to store the operation. Creating new logfiles is
normally slow, so ArangoDB will try to pre-create logfiles in a background
process so there are always reserve logfiles when the active logfile gets
full. The number of reserve logfiles that ArangoDB keeps in the background
is configurable with this option.

These *examples* can have the following values:

* *null*, there is no matching executed all found results are valid.
* A *string*, only results are returned, which *_id* equal the value of the string
* An example *object*, defining a set of attributes.
    Only results having these attributes are matched.

be executed asynchronously.

The default is *true*.
When set to `false` the queue manager will be disabled and any jobs
are prevented from being processed, which may reduce CPU load a bit.

<!-- filename: /work/ArangoDB/Documentation/DocuBlocks/collectionWithin.md -->
@startDocuBlock collectionWithin

@brief constructs a within query for a collection
`collection.within(latitude, longitude, radius)`

This will find all documents within a given radius around the coordinate
(*latitude*, *longitude*). The returned array is sorted by distance,
beginning with the nearest document.

In order to use the *within* operator, a geo index must be defined for the
collection. This index also defines which attribute holds the coordinates
for the document.  If you have more then one geo-spatial index, you can use
the `geo` operator to select a particular index.


`collection.within(latitude, longitude, radius).distance()`

This will add an attribute `_distance` to all documents returned, which
contains the distance between the given point and the document in meters.

`collection.within(latitude, longitude, radius).distance(name)`

This will add an attribute *name* to all documents returned, which
contains the distance between the given point and the document in meters.

**Note**: this method is not yet supported by the RocksDB storage engine.

Note: the *within* simple query function is **deprecated** as of ArangoDB 2.6.
The function may be removed in future versions of ArangoDB. The preferred
way for retrieving documents from a collection using the within operator  is
to use the AQL *WITHIN* function in an AQL query as follows:

```
FOR doc IN WITHIN(@@collection, @latitude, @longitude, @radius, @distanceAttributeName)
    RETURN doc
```

@EXAMPLES

To find all documents within a radius of 2000 km use:

@startDocuBlock WalLogfileSize

@brief the size of each WAL logfile
`--wal.logfile-size`

Specifies the filesize (in bytes) for each write-ahead logfile. The
logfile
size should be chosen so that each logfile can store a considerable amount
of
documents. The bigger the logfile size is chosen, the longer it will take
to fill up a single logfile, which also influences the delay until the
data
in a logfile will be garbage-collected and written to collection journals
and datafiles. It also affects how long logfile recovery will take at
server start.

@brief force syncing of collection properties to disk
`--database.force-sync-properties boolean`

Force syncing of collection properties to disk after creating a collection
or updating its properties.

If turned off, no fsync will happen for the collection and database
properties stored in `parameter.json` files in the file system. Turning
off this option will speed up workloads that create and drop a lot of
collections (e.g. test suites).

The default is *true*.

<!-- filename: /work/ArangoDB/Documentation/DocuBlocks/collectionProperties.md -->
@startDocuBlock collectionProperties

@brief gets or sets the properties of a collection
`collection.properties()`

Returns an object containing all collection properties.

* *waitForSync*: If *true* creating a document will only return
  after the data was synced to disk.

* *journalSize* : The size of the journal in bytes.
  This option is meaningful for the MMFiles storage engine only.

* *isVolatile*: If *true* then the collection data will be
  kept in memory only and ArangoDB will not write or sync the data
  to disk.
  This option is meaningful for the MMFiles storage engine only.

* *keyOptions* (optional) additional options for key generation. This is
  a JSON array containing the following attributes (note: some of the
  attributes are optional):
  * *type*: the type of the key generator used for the collection.
  * *allowUserKeys*: if set to *true*, then it is allowed to supply
    own key values in the *_key* attribute of a document. If set to
    *false*, then the key generator will solely be responsible for
    generating keys and supplying own key values in the *_key* attribute
    of documents is considered an error.
  * *increment*: increment value for *autoincrement* key generator.
    Not used for other key generator types.
  * *offset*: initial offset value for *autoincrement* key generator.
    Not used for other key generator types.

* *indexBuckets*: number of buckets into which indexes using a hash
  table are split. The default is 16 and this number has to be a
  power of 2 and less than or equal to 1024.
  This option is meaningful for the MMFiles storage engine only.

  For very large collections one should increase this to avoid long pauses
  when the hash table has to be initially built or resized, since buckets
  are resized individually and can be initially built in parallel. For
  example, 64 might be a sensible value for a collection with 100
  000 000 documents. Currently, only the edge index respects this
  value, but other index types might follow in future ArangoDB versions.
  Changes (see below) are applied when the collection is loaded the next
  time.

In a cluster setup, the result will also contain the following attributes:

* *numberOfShards*: the number of shards of the collection.

* *shardKeys*: contains the names of document attributes that are used to
  determine the target shard for documents.

* *replicationFactor*: determines how many copies of each shard are kept 
  on different DBServers. Has to be in the range of 1-10 *(Cluster only)*

* *minReplicationFactor* : determines the number of minimal shard copies kept on
  different DBServers, a shard will refuse to write if less than this amount
  of copies are in sync. Has to be in the range of 1-replicationFactor *(Cluster only)*

* *shardingStrategy*: the sharding strategy selected for the collection.
  This attribute will only be populated in cluster mode and is not populated
  in single-server mode.

`collection.properties(properties)`

Changes the collection properties. *properties* must be an object with
one or more of the following attribute(s):

* *waitForSync*: If *true* creating a document will only return
  after the data was synced to disk.

* *journalSize* : The size of the journal in bytes.
  This option is meaningful for the MMFiles storage engine only.

* *indexBuckets* : See above, changes are only applied when the
  collection is loaded the next time.
  This option is meaningful for the MMFiles storage engine only.

* *replicationFactor* : Change the number of shard copies kept on 
  different DBServers, valid values are  integer numbers
  in the range of 1-10 *(Cluster only)*

* *minReplicationFactor* : Change the number of minimal shard copies to be in sync on 
  different DBServers, a shard will refuse to write if less than this amount
  of copies are in sync. Has to be in the range of 1-replicationFactor *(Cluster only)*

**Note**: some other collection properties, such as *type*, *isVolatile*,
*keyOptions*, *numberOfShards* or *shardingStrategy* cannot be changed once 
the collection is created.

@brief restores from a local backup

@RESTHEADER{POST /_admin/backup/restore, Restore backup}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Restores a consistent backup from a
snapshot in time, with a given id. The backup snapshot must reside on
the ArangoDB service locally.

@RESTBODYPARAM{id,string,required,string}
The id of the backup to restore from.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
Is returned if the backup could be restored. Note that there is an
inevitable discrepancy between the single server and the cluster. In a
single server, the request returns successfully, but the restore is
only executed afterwards. In the cluster, the request only returns when
the restore operation has been completed successfully. The cluster
behaviour is obviously the desired one, but in a single instance, one
cannot keep a connection open across a restart.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
If the restore command is invoked with bad parameters or any HTTP
method other than `POST`, then an *HTTP 400* is returned. The specifics
are detailed in the returned error document.

@brief creates a local backup

@RESTHEADER{POST /_admin/backup/create, Create backup}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Creates a consistent backup "as soon as possible", very much
like a snapshot in time, with a given label. The ambiguity in the
phrase "as soon as possible" refers to the next window during which a
global write lock across all databases can be obtained in order to
guarantee consistency. Note that the backup at first resides on the
same machine and hard drive as the original data. Make sure to upload
it to a remote site for an actual backup.

@RESTBODYPARAM{label,string,optional,string}
The label for this backup. The label is used together with a
timestamp string create a unique backup identifier, `<timestamp>_<label>`.
If no label is specified, the empty string is assumed and a default
UUID is created for this part of the ID.

@RESTBODYPARAM{timeout,number,optional,double}
The time in seconds that the operation tries to get a consistent
snapshot. The default is 120 seconds. 

@RESTBODYPARAM{allowInconsistent,boolean,optional,boolean}
If this flag is set to `true` and no global transaction lock can be
acquired within the given timeout, a possibly inconsistent backup
is taken. The default for this flag is `false` and in this case
a timeout results in an HTTP 408 error.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
If all is well, code 201 is returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
If the create command is invoked with bad parameters or any HTTP
method other than `POST`, then an *HTTP 400* is returned. The specifics
are detailed in the returned error document.

@RESTRETURNCODE{408}
If the operation cannot obtain a global transaction lock
within the timeout, then an *HTTP 408* is returned.

The result `body` contains besides the above discussed error codes the `result` object, if `code` is equal to `201`, which holds the unique identifier of this hot backup as the string attibute `id`, the full size in bytes as `sizeInBytes`, the number of idividual files as `nrFiles` and the number of database servers as `nrDBServers`. Single server deployments list potentially misleadingly `nrDBServers: 1`. Furthermore, the body contains a `datetime` time stamp and the flag `potentiallyInconsistent`, which indicates that the backup could inconsistent. This only happens if `allowInconsistent` has happened.

The result consists of a `list` object of hot backups by their `id`, where `id` uniquely identifies a specific hot backup, `version` depicts the version of ArangoDB, which was used to create any individual hot backup and `datetime` displays the time of creation of the hot backup. Further parameters are the size of the backup in bytes as `sizeInBytes`, the number of individual data files as `nrFiles`, the number of db servers at time of creation as `nrDBServers`, the number of backup parts, which are found on the currently reachable db servers as `nrPiecesPresent`. If the backup was created allowing inconsistences, it is so denoted as `potentiallyInconsistent`. The `available` boolean parameter is tightly connected to the backup to be present and ready to be restored on all db servers. It is `true` except, when the number of db servers currently reachable does not match to the number of db servers listed in the backup.

@brief download a specific local backup

@RESTHEADER{POST /_admin/backup/download, Download a backup from a remote repository}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Download a specific local backup from a remote repository, or query
progress on a previously scheduled download operation, or abort
a running download operation.

@RESTBODYPARAM{id,string,optional,string}
The identifier for this backup. This is required when a download
operation is scheduled. In this case leave out the `downloadId`
attribute.

@RESTBODYPARAM{remoteRepository,string,required,string}
URL of remote reporsitory. This is required when a download
operation is scheduled. In this case leave out the `downloadId`
attribute. Provided repository URLs are normalized and validated as follows: One single colon must appear separating the configurtion section name and the path. The URL prefix up to the colon must exist as a key in the config object below. No slashes must appear before the colon. Multiple back to back slashes are collapsed to one, as `..` and `.` are applied accordingly. Local repositories must be absolute paths and must begin with a `/`. Trailing `/` are removed.  

@RESTBODYPARAM{config,object,required,object}
Configuration of remote repository. This is required when a download
operation is scheduled. In this case leave out the `downloadId`
attribute. See the description of the _arangobackup_ program in the manual
for a description of the `config` object.

@RESTBODYPARAM{downloadId,string,optional,string}
Download ID to specify for which download operation progress is queried, or
the download operation to abort.
If you specify this, leave out all the above body parameters.

@RESTBODYPARAM{abort,boolean,optional,boolean}
Set this to `true` if a running download operation should be aborted. In
this case, the only other body parameter which is needed is `downloadId`.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
If all is well, code 200 is returned if progress is inquired or the
operation is aborted.

@RESTRETURNCODE{202}
If all is well, code 202 is returned if a new operation is scheduled.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
If the download command is invoked with bad parameters or any HTTP
method other than `POST`, then an *HTTP 400* is returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{401}
If the authentication to the rempote repository fails, then an *HTTP
401* is returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
If a backup corresponding to the identifier `id`  cannot be found, or if
there is no known download operation with the given `downloadId`.

<!-- filename: /work/ArangoDB/Documentation/DocuBlocks/Rest/Bulk/import_document.md -->
@startDocuBlock import_document

@brief imports documents from JSON-encoded lists

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/import#document,imports document values, RestImportHandler#document}

@RESTALLBODYPARAM{documents,string,required}
The body must consist of JSON-encoded arrays of attribute values, with one
line per document. The first row of the request must be a JSON-encoded
array of attribute names. These attribute names are used for the data in the
subsequent lines.

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{collection,string,required}
The collection name.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{fromPrefix,string,optional}
An optional prefix for the values in `_from` attributes. If specified, the
value is automatically prepended to each `_from` input value. This allows
specifying just the keys for `_from`.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{toPrefix,string,optional}
An optional prefix for the values in `_to` attributes. If specified, the
value is automatically prepended to each `_to` input value. This allows
specifying just the keys for `_to`.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{overwrite,boolean,optional}
If this parameter has a value of `true` or `yes`, then all data in the
collection will be removed prior to the import. Note that any existing
index definitions will be preseved.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{waitForSync,boolean,optional}
Wait until documents have been synced to disk before returning.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{onDuplicate,string,optional}
Controls what action is carried out in case of a unique key constraint
violation. Possible values are:

- *error*: this will not import the current document because of the unique
  key constraint violation. This is the default setting.

- *update*: this will update an existing document in the database with the
  data specified in the request. Attributes of the existing document that
  are not present in the request will be preseved.

- *replace*: this will replace an existing document in the database with the
  data specified in the request.

- *ignore*: this will not update an existing document and simply ignore the
  error caused by the unique key constraint violation.

Note that *update*, *replace* and *ignore* will only work when the
import document in the request contains the *_key* attribute. *update* and
*replace* may also fail because of secondary unique key constraint
violations.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{complete,boolean,optional}
If set to `true` or `yes`, it will make the whole import fail if any error
occurs. Otherwise the import will continue even if some documents cannot
be imported.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{details,boolean,optional}
If set to `true` or `yes`, the result will include an attribute `details`
with details about documents that could not be imported.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
**NOTE** Swagger examples won't work due to the anchor.


Creates documents in the collection identified by `collection-name`.
The first line of the request body must contain a JSON-encoded array of
attribute names. All following lines in the request body must contain
JSON-encoded arrays of attribute values. Each line is interpreted as a
separate document, and the values specified will be mapped to the array
of attribute names specified in the first header line.

The response is a JSON object with the following attributes:

- `created`: number of documents imported.

- `errors`: number of documents that were not imported due to an error.

- `empty`: number of empty lines found in the input (will only contain a
  value greater zero for types `documents` or `auto`).

- `updated`: number of updated/replaced documents (in case `onDuplicate`
  was set to either `update` or `replace`).

- `ignored`: number of failed but ignored insert operations (in case
  `onDuplicate` was set to `ignore`).

- `details`: if query parameter `details` is set to true, the result will
  contain a `details` attribute which is an array with more detailed
  information about which documents could not be inserted.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
is returned if all documents could be imported successfully.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if `type` contains an invalid value, no `collection` is
specified, the documents are incorrectly encoded, or the request
is malformed.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
is returned if `collection` or the `_from` or `_to` attributes of an
imported edge refer to an unknown collection.

@RESTRETURNCODE{409}
is returned if the import would trigger a unique key violation and
`complete` is set to `true`.

@RESTRETURNCODE{500}
is returned if the server cannot auto-generate a document key (out of keys
error) for a document with no user-defined key.

@startDocuBlock post_api_export

@brief export all documents from a collection, using a cursor

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/export, Create export cursor, createCursorExport}

@RESTBODYPARAM{flush,boolean,required,}
if set to *true*, a WAL flush operation will be executed prior to the
export. The flush operation will start copying documents from the WAL to the
collection's datafiles. There will be an additional wait time of up
to *flushWait* seconds after the flush to allow the WAL collector to change
the adjusted document meta-data to point into the datafiles, too.
The default value is *false* (i.e. no flush) so most recently inserted or
updated
documents from the collection might be missing in the export.

@RESTBODYPARAM{flushWait,integer,required,int64}
maximum wait time in seconds after a flush operation. The default
value is 10. This option only has an effect when *flush* is set to *true*.

@RESTBODYPARAM{count,boolean,required,}
boolean flag that indicates whether the number of documents
in the result set should be returned in the "count" attribute of the result
(optional).
Calculating the "count" attribute might in the future have a performance
impact so this option is turned off by default, and "count" is only returned
when requested.

@RESTBODYPARAM{batchSize,integer,required,int64}
maximum number of result documents to be transferred from
the server to the client in one roundtrip (optional). If this attribute is
not set, a server-controlled default value will be used.

@RESTBODYPARAM{limit,integer,required,int64}
an optional limit value, determining the maximum number of documents to
be included in the cursor. Omitting the *limit* attribute or setting it to 0 will
lead to no limit being used. If a limit is used, it is undefined which documents
from the collection will be included in the export and which will be excluded. 
This is because there is no natural order of documents in a collection.

@RESTBODYPARAM{ttl,integer,required,int64}
an optional time-to-live for the cursor (in seconds). The cursor will be
removed on the server automatically after the specified amount of time. This
is useful to ensure garbage collection of cursors that are not fully fetched
by clients. If not set, a server-defined value will be used.

@RESTBODYPARAM{restrict,object,optional,post_api_export_restrictions}
an object containing an array of attribute names that will be 
included or excluded when returning result documents.

Not specifying *restrict* will by default return all attributes of each document.

@RESTSTRUCT{type,post_api_export_restrictions,string,required,string}
has to be be set to either *include* or *exclude* depending on which you want to use

@RESTSTRUCT{fields,post_api_export_restrictions,array,required,string}
Contains an array of attribute names to *include* or *exclude*. Matching of attribute names
for *inclusion* or *exclusion* will be done on the top level only.
Specifying names of nested attributes is not supported at the moment.


@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{collection,string,required}
The name of the collection to export.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
A call to this method creates a cursor containing all documents in the 
specified collection. In contrast to other data-producing APIs, the internal
data structures produced by the export API are more lightweight, so it is
the preferred way to retrieve all documents from a collection.

Documents are returned in a similar manner as in the `/_api/cursor` REST API. 
If all documents of the collection fit into the first batch, then no cursor
will be created, and the result object's *hasMore* attribute will be set to
*false*. If not all documents fit into the first batch, then the result 
object's *hasMore* attribute will be set to *true*, and the *id* attribute
of the result will contain a cursor id.

The order in which the documents are returned is not specified.

By default, only those documents from the collection will be returned that are
stored in the collection's datafiles. Documents that are present in the write-ahead
log (WAL) at the time the export is run will not be exported.

To export these documents as well, the caller can issue a WAL flush request
before calling the export API or set the *flush* attribute. Setting the *flush*
option will trigger a WAL flush before the export so documents get copied from 
the WAL to the collection datafiles.

If the result set can be created by the server, the server will respond with
*HTTP 201*. The body of the response will contain a JSON object with the
result set.

The returned JSON object has the following properties:

- *error*: boolean flag to indicate that an error occurred (*false*
  in this case)

- *code*: the HTTP status code

- *result*: an array of result documents (might be empty if the collection was empty)

- *hasMore*: a boolean indicator whether there are more results
  available for the cursor on the server

- *count*: the total number of result documents available (only
  available if the query was executed with the *count* attribute set)

- *id*: id of temporary cursor created on the server (optional, see above)

If the JSON representation is malformed or the query specification is
missing from the request, the server will respond with *HTTP 400*.

The body of the response will contain a JSON object with additional error
details. The object has the following attributes:

- *error*: boolean flag to indicate that an error occurred (*true* in this case)

- *code*: the HTTP status code

- *errorNum*: the server error number

- *errorMessage*: a descriptive error message

Clients should always delete an export cursor result as early as possible because a
lingering export cursor will prevent the underlying collection from being
compacted or unloaded. By default, unused cursors will be deleted automatically 
after a server-defined idle time, and clients can adjust this idle time by setting
the *ttl* value.

Note: this API is currently not supported on cluster coordinators.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
is returned if the result set can be created by the server.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if the JSON representation is malformed or the query specification is
missing from the request.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
The server will respond with *HTTP 404* in case a non-existing collection is
accessed in the query.

@RESTRETURNCODE{405}
The server will respond with *HTTP 405* if an unsupported HTTP method is used.

@RESTRETURNCODE{501}
The server will respond with *HTTP 501* if this API is called on a cluster
coordinator.

@startDocuBlock batch_processing

@brief executes a batch request

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/batch,executes a batch request, RestBatchHandler} TODOSWAGGER: contentype

@RESTALLBODYPARAM{body,string,required}
The multipart batch request, consisting of the envelope and the individual
batch parts.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Executes a batch request. A batch request can contain any number of
other requests that can be sent to ArangoDB in isolation. The benefit of
using batch requests is that batching requests requires less client/server
roundtrips than when sending isolated requests.

All parts of a batch request are executed serially on the server. The
server will return the results of all parts in a single response when all
parts are finished.

Technically, a batch request is a multipart HTTP request, with
content-type `multipart/form-data`. A batch request consists of an
envelope and the individual batch part actions. Batch part actions
are "regular" HTTP requests, including full header and an optional body.
Multiple batch parts are separated by a boundary identifier. The
boundary identifier is declared in the batch envelope. The MIME content-type
for each individual batch part must be `application/x-arango-batchpart`.

Please note that when constructing the individual batch parts, you must
use CRLF (`\r\n`) as the line terminator as in regular HTTP messages.

The response sent by the server will be an `HTTP 200` response, with an
optional error summary header `x-arango-errors`. This header contains the
number of batch part operations that failed with an HTTP error code of at
least 400. This header is only present in the response if the number of
errors is greater than zero.

The response sent by the server is a multipart response, too. It contains
the individual HTTP responses for all batch parts, including the full HTTP
result header (with status code and other potential headers) and an
optional result body. The individual batch parts in the result are
seperated using the same boundary value as specified in the request.

The order of batch parts in the response will be the same as in the
original client request. Client can additionally use the `Content-Id`
MIME header in a batch part to define an individual id for each batch part.
The server will return this id is the batch part responses, too.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
is returned if the batch was received successfully. HTTP 200 is returned
even if one or multiple batch part actions failed.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if the batch envelope is malformed or incorrectly formatted.
This code will also be returned if the content-type of the overall batch
request or the individual MIME parts is not as expected.

@RESTRETURNCODE{405}
is returned when an invalid HTTP method is used.

@EXAMPLES

Sending a batch request with five batch parts:

- GET /_api/version

- DELETE /_api/collection/products

- POST /_api/collection/products

- GET /_api/collection/products/figures

- DELETE /_api/collection/products

The boundary (`SomeBoundaryValue`) is passed to the server in the HTTP
`Content-Type` HTTP header.
*Please note the reply is not displayed all accurate.*

@startDocuBlock import_json

@brief imports documents from JSON

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/import#json,imports documents from JSON, RestImportHandler}

@RESTALLBODYPARAM{documents,string,required}
The body must either be a JSON-encoded array of objects or a string with
multiple JSON objects separated by newlines.

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{type,string,required}
Determines how the body of the request will be interpreted. `type` can have
the following values:
- `documents`: when this type is used, each line in the request body is
  expected to be an individual JSON-encoded document. Multiple JSON objects
  in the request body need to be separated by newlines.
- `list`: when this type is used, the request body must contain a single
  JSON-encoded array of individual objects to import.
- `auto`: if set, this will automatically determine the body type (either
  `documents` or `list`).

@RESTQUERYPARAM{collection,string,required}
The collection name.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{fromPrefix,string,optional}
An optional prefix for the values in `_from` attributes. If specified, the
value is automatically prepended to each `_from` input value. This allows
specifying just the keys for `_from`.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{toPrefix,string,optional}
An optional prefix for the values in `_to` attributes. If specified, the
value is automatically prepended to each `_to` input value. This allows
specifying just the keys for `_to`.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{overwrite,boolean,optional}
If this parameter has a value of `true` or `yes`, then all data in the
collection will be removed prior to the import. Note that any existing
index definitions will be preseved.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{waitForSync,boolean,optional}
Wait until documents have been synced to disk before returning.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{onDuplicate,string,optional}
Controls what action is carried out in case of a unique key constraint
violation. Possible values are:

- *error*: this will not import the current document because of the unique
  key constraint violation. This is the default setting.

- *update*: this will update an existing document in the database with the 
  data specified in the request. Attributes of the existing document that
  are not present in the request will be preseved.

- *replace*: this will replace an existing document in the database with the
  data specified in the request. 

- *ignore*: this will not update an existing document and simply ignore the
  error caused by a unique key constraint violation.

Note that that *update*, *replace* and *ignore* will only work when the
import document in the request contains the *_key* attribute. *update* and
*replace* may also fail because of secondary unique key constraint violations.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{complete,boolean,optional}
If set to `true` or `yes`, it will make the whole import fail if any error
occurs. Otherwise the import will continue even if some documents cannot
be imported.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{details,boolean,optional}
If set to `true` or `yes`, the result will include an attribute `details`
with details about documents that could not be imported.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
**NOTE** Swagger examples won't work due to the anchor.


Creates documents in the collection identified by `collection-name`.
The JSON representations of the documents must be passed as the body of the
POST request. The request body can either consist of multiple lines, with
each line being a single stand-alone JSON object, or a singe JSON array with
sub-objects.

The response is a JSON object with the following attributes:

- `created`: number of documents imported.

- `errors`: number of documents that were not imported due to an error.

- `empty`: number of empty lines found in the input (will only contain a
  value greater zero for types `documents` or `auto`).

- `updated`: number of updated/replaced documents (in case `onDuplicate`
  was set to either `update` or `replace`).

- `ignored`: number of failed but ignored insert operations (in case
  `onDuplicate` was set to `ignore`).

- `details`: if query parameter `details` is set to true, the result will
  contain a `details` attribute which is an array with more detailed
  information about which documents could not be inserted.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
is returned if all documents could be imported successfully.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if `type` contains an invalid value, no `collection` is
specified, the documents are incorrectly encoded, or the request
is malformed.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
is returned if `collection` or the `_from` or `_to` attributes of an
imported edge refer to an unknown collection.

@RESTRETURNCODE{409}
is returned if the import would trigger a unique key violation and
`complete` is set to `true`.

@RESTRETURNCODE{500}
is returned if the server cannot auto-generate a document key (out of keys
error) for a document with no user-defined key.

@startDocuBlock put_cluster_maintenance

@brief Enable or disable the cluster supervision (agency) maintenance mode

@RESTHEADER{PUT /_admin/cluster/maintenance, Enable or disable the supervision maintenance mode}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
This API allows you to temporarily enable the supervision maintenance mode. Be aware that no 
automatic failovers of any kind will take place while the maintenance mode is enabled.
The _cluster_ supervision reactivates itself automatically _60 minutes_ after disabling it.

To enable the maintenance mode the request body must contain the string `"on"`. To disable it, send the string
`"off"` (Please note it _must_ be lowercase as well as include the quotes).

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200} is returned when everything went well.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400} if the request contained an invalid body

@RESTRETURNCODE{501} if the request was sent to a node other than a coordinator or single-server

@RESTRETURNCODE{504} if the request timed out while enabling the maintenance mode

<!-- filename: /work/ArangoDB/Documentation/DocuBlocks/Rest/Cluster/get_cluster_health.md -->
@startDocuBlock get_cluster_health

@brief Returns the health of the cluster as assessed by the supervision (agency)

@RESTHEADER{GET /_admin/cluster/health, Queries the health of cluster for monitoring}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Queries the health of the cluster for monitoring purposes. The response is a JSON object, containing the standard `code`, `error`, `errorNum`, and `errorMessage` fields as appropriate. The endpoint-specific fields are as follows:

- `ClusterId`: A UUID string identifying the cluster
- `Health`: An object containing a descriptive sub-object for each node in the cluster.
  - `<nodeID>`: Each entry in `Health` will be keyed by the node ID and contain the following attributes:
    - `Endpoint`: A string representing the network endpoint of the server.
    - `Role`: The role the server plays. Possible values are `"AGENT"`, `"COORDINATOR"`, and `"DBSERVER"`.
    - `CanBeDeleted`: Boolean representing whether the node can safely be removed from the cluster.
    - `Version`: Version String of ArangoDB used by that node.
    - `Engine`: Storage Engine used by that node.
    - `Status`: A string indicating the health of the node as assessed by the supervision (agency). This should be considered primary source of truth for coordinator and dbservers node health. If the node is responding normally to requests, it is `"GOOD"`. If it has missed one heartbeat, it is `"BAD"`. If it has been declared failed by the supervision, which occurs after missing heartbeats for about 15 seconds, it will be marked `"FAILED"`.

    Additionally it will also have the following attributes for:

    **Coordinators** and **DBServers**
    - `SyncStatus`: The last sync status reported by the node. This value is primarily used to determine the value of `Status`. Possible values include `"UNKNOWN"`, `"UNDEFINED"`, `"STARTUP"`, `"STOPPING"`, `"STOPPED"`, `"SERVING"`, `"SHUTDOWN"`.
    - `LastAckedTime`: ISO 8601 timestamp specifying the last heartbeat received.
    - `ShortName`: A string representing the shortname of the server, e.g. `"Coordinator0001"`.
    - `Timestamp`: ISO 8601 timestamp specifying the last heartbeat received. (deprecated)
    - `Host`: An optional string, specifying the host machine if known.

    **Coordinators** only
    - `AdvertisedEndpoint`: A string representing the advertised endpoint, if set. (e.g. external IP address or load balancer, optional)

    **Agents**
    - `Leader`: ID of the agent this node regards as leader.
    - `Leading`: Whether this agent is the leader (true) or not (false).
    - `LastAckedTime`: Time since last `acked` in seconds.

@brief deletes an async job result

@RESTHEADER{DELETE /_api/job/{type}, Deletes async job, deleteJob:byType}

@RESTURLPARAMETERS

@RESTURLPARAM{type,string,required}
The type of jobs to delete. type can be:
* *all*: Deletes all jobs results. Currently executing or queued async 
  jobs will not be stopped by this call.
* *expired*: Deletes expired results. To determine the expiration status of a 
  result, pass the stamp query parameter. stamp needs to be a UNIX timestamp, 
  and all async job results created at a lower timestamp will be deleted.
* *an actual job-id*: In this case, the call will remove the result of the
  specified async job. If the job is currently executing or queued, it will
  not be aborted.

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{stamp,number,optional}
A UNIX timestamp specifying the expiration threshold when type is expired.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Deletes either all job results, expired job results, or the result of a
specific job.
Clients can use this method to perform an eventual garbage collection of job
results.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
is returned if the deletion operation was carried out successfully.
This code will also be returned if no results were deleted.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if type is not specified or has an invalid value.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
is returned if type is a job-id but no async job with the specified id was
found.

@startDocuBlock job_getByType

@brief Returns the ids of job results with a specific status

@RESTHEADER{GET /_api/job/{type}, Returns list of async jobs, getJob}

@RESTURLPARAMETERS

@RESTURLPARAM{type,string,required}
The type of jobs to return. The type can be either done or pending. Setting
the type to done will make the method return the ids of already completed
async
jobs for which results can be fetched. Setting the type to pending will
return
the ids of not yet finished async jobs.

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{count,number,optional}

The maximum number of ids to return per call. If not specified, a
server-defined maximum value will be used.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Returns the list of ids of async jobs with a specific status (either done or
pending).
The list can be used by the client to get an overview of the job system
status and
to retrieve completed job results later.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
is returned if the list can be compiled successfully. Note: the list might
be empty.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if type is not specified or has an invalid value.

@EXAMPLES

@startDocuBlock job_fetch_result

@brief fetches a job result and removes it from the queue

@RESTHEADER{PUT /_api/job/{job-id}, Return result of an async job, getJobResult}

@RESTURLPARAMETERS

@RESTURLPARAM{job-id,string,required}
The async job id.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Returns the result of an async job identified by job-id. If the async job
result is present on the server, the result will be removed from the list of
result. That means this method can be called for each job-id once.
The method will return the original job result's headers and body, plus the
additional HTTP header x-arango-async-job-id. If this header is present,
then
the job was found and the response contains the original job's result. If
the header is not present, the job was not found and the response contains
status information from the job manager.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{204}
is returned if the job requested via job-id is still in the queue of pending
(or not yet finished) jobs. In this case, no x-arango-async-id HTTP header
will be returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if no job-id was specified in the request. In this case,
no x-arango-async-id HTTP header will be returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
is returned if the job was not found or already deleted or fetched from
the job result list. In this case, no x-arango-async-id HTTP header will
be returned.

@EXAMPLES
Not providing a job-id:

<!-- filename: /work/ArangoDB/Documentation/DocuBlocks/Rest/Administration/get_admin_statistics.md -->
@startDocuBlock get_admin_statistics

@brief return the statistics information

@RESTHEADER{GET /_admin/statistics, Read the statistics, getStatistics}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Returns the statistics information. The returned object contains the
statistics figures grouped together according to the description returned by
*_admin/statistics-description*. For instance, to access a figure *userTime*
from the group *system*, you first select the sub-object describing the
group stored in *system* and in that sub-object the value for *userTime* is
stored in the attribute of the same name.

In case of a distribution, the returned object contains the total count in
*count* and the distribution list in *counts*. The sum (or total) of the
individual values is returned in *sum*.

The transaction statistics show the local started, committed and aborted
transactions as well as intermediate commits done for the server queried. The
intermediate commit count will only take non zero values for the RocksDB
storage engine. Coordinators do almost no local transactions themselves in
their local databases, therefor cluster transactions (transactions started on a
coordinator that require DBServers to finish before the transactions is
committed cluster wide) are just added to their local statistics. This means
that the statistics you would see for a single server is roughly what you can
expect in a cluster setup using a single coordinator querying this coordinator.
Just with the difference that cluster transactions have no notion of
intermediate commits and will not increase the value.

@startDocuBlock post_admin_execute

@brief Execute a script on the server.

@RESTHEADER{POST /_admin/execute, Execute program, RestAdminExecuteHandler}

@RESTALLBODYPARAM{body,string,required}
The body to be executed.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Executes the javascript code in the body on the server as the body
of a function with no arguments. If you have a *return* statement
then the return value you produce will be returned as content type
*application/json*. If the parameter *returnAsJSON* is set to
*true*, the result will be a JSON object describing the return value
directly, otherwise a string produced by JSON.stringify will be
returned.

Note that this API endpoint will only be present if the server was
started with the option `--javascript.allow-admin-execute true`.

The default value of this option is `false`, which disables the execution of 
user-defined code and disables this API endpoint entirely. 
This is also the recommended setting for production. 

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
is returned when everything went well, or if a timeout occurred. In the
latter case a body of type application/json indicating the timeout
is returned. depending on *returnAsJSON* this is a json object or a plain string.

@RESTRETURNCODE{403}
is returned if ArangoDB is not running in cluster mode.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
is returned if ArangoDB was not compiled for cluster operation.

@HINTS
{% hint 'warning' %}
This route should no longer be used.
It is considered as deprecated from version 3.4.0 on.
{% endhint %}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Returns an array of all configured endpoints the server is listening on.

The result is a JSON array of JSON objects, each with `"entrypoint"' as
the only attribute, and with the value being a string describing the
endpoint.

**Note**: retrieving the array of all endpoints is allowed in the system database
only. Calling this action in any other database will make the server return
an error.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
is returned when the array of endpoints can be determined successfully.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if the action is not carried out in the system database.

@RESTRETURNCODE{405}
The server will respond with *HTTP 405* if an unsupported HTTP method is used.

@brief return the next results from an existing cursor

@RESTHEADER{PUT /_api/cursor/{cursor-identifier}, Read next batch from cursor, modifyQueryCursor}

@RESTURLPARAMETERS

@RESTURLPARAM{cursor-identifier,string,required}
The name of the cursor

@RESTDESCRIPTION
If the cursor is still alive, returns an object with the following
attributes:

- *id*: the *cursor-identifier*
- *result*: a list of documents for the current batch
- *hasMore*: *false* if this was the last batch
- *count*: if present the total number of elements

Note that even if *hasMore* returns *true*, the next call might
still return no documents. If, however, *hasMore* is *false*, then
the cursor is exhausted.  Once the *hasMore* attribute has a value of
*false*, the client can stop.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
The server will respond with *HTTP 200* in case of success.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
If the cursor identifier is omitted, the server will respond with *HTTP 404*.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
If no cursor with the specified identifier can be found, the server will respond
with *HTTP 404*.

@startDocuBlock post_api_cursor_delete

@brief dispose an existing cursor

@RESTHEADER{DELETE /_api/cursor/{cursor-identifier}, Delete cursor, deleteQueryCursor}

@RESTURLPARAMETERS

@RESTURLPARAM{cursor-identifier,string,required}
The id of the cursor

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Deletes the cursor and frees the resources associated with it.

The cursor will automatically be destroyed on the server when the client has
retrieved all documents from it. The client can also explicitly destroy the
cursor at any earlier time using an HTTP DELETE request. The cursor id must
be included as part of the URL.

Note: the server will also destroy abandoned cursors automatically after a
certain server-controlled timeout to avoid resource leakage.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{202}
is returned if the server is aware of the cursor.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
is returned if the server is not aware of the cursor. It is also
returned if a cursor is used after it has been destroyed.

@startDocuBlock post_api_cursor

@brief create a cursor and return the first results

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/cursor, Create cursor, createQueryCursor}

A JSON object describing the query and query parameters.

@RESTBODYPARAM{query,string,required,string}
contains the query string to be executed

@RESTBODYPARAM{count,boolean,optional,}
indicates whether the number of documents in the result set should be returned in
the "count" attribute of the result.
Calculating the "count" attribute might have a performance impact for some queries
in the future so this option is turned off by default, and "count"
is only returned when requested.

@RESTBODYPARAM{batchSize,integer,optional,int64}
maximum number of result documents to be transferred from
the server to the client in one roundtrip. If this attribute is
not set, a server-controlled default value will be used. A *batchSize* value of
*0* is disallowed.

@RESTBODYPARAM{ttl,integer,optional,int64}
The time-to-live for the cursor (in seconds). The cursor will be
removed on the server automatically after the specified amount of time. This
is useful to ensure garbage collection of cursors that are not fully fetched
by clients. If not set, a server-defined value will be used (default: 30 seconds).

@RESTBODYPARAM{cache,boolean,optional,}
flag to determine whether the AQL query results cache
shall be used. If set to *false*, then any query cache lookup will be skipped
for the query. If set to *true*, it will lead to the query cache being checked
for the query if the query cache mode is either *on* or *demand*.

@RESTBODYPARAM{memoryLimit,integer,optional,int64}
the maximum number of memory (measured in bytes) that the query is allowed to
use. If set, then the query will fail with error "resource limit exceeded" in
case it allocates too much memory. A value of *0* indicates that there is no
memory limit.

@RESTBODYPARAM{bindVars,array,optional,object}
key/value pairs representing the bind parameters.

@RESTBODYPARAM{options,object,optional,post_api_cursor_opts}
key/value object with extra options for the query.

@RESTSTRUCT{fullCount,post_api_cursor_opts,boolean,optional,}
if set to *true* and the query contains a *LIMIT* clause, then the
result will have an *extra* attribute with the sub-attributes *stats*
and *fullCount*, `{ ... , "extra": { "stats": { "fullCount": 123 } } }`.
The *fullCount* attribute will contain the number of documents in the result before the
last top-level LIMIT in the query was applied. It can be used to count the number of 
documents that match certain filter criteria, but only return a subset of them, in one go.
It is thus similar to MySQL's *SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS* hint. Note that setting the option
will disable a few LIMIT optimizations and may lead to more documents being processed,
and thus make queries run longer. Note that the *fullCount* attribute may only
be present in the result if the query has a top-level LIMIT clause and the LIMIT 
clause is actually used in the query.

@RESTSTRUCT{maxPlans,post_api_cursor_opts,integer,optional,int64}
Limits the maximum number of plans that are created by the AQL query optimizer.

@RESTSTRUCT{maxWarningCount,post_api_cursor_opts,integer,optional,int64}
Limits the maximum number of warnings a query will return. The number of warnings
a query will return is limited to 10 by default, but that number can be increased
or decreased by setting this attribute.

@RESTSTRUCT{failOnWarning,post_api_cursor_opts,boolean,optional,}
When set to *true*, the query will throw an exception and abort instead of producing
a warning. This option should be used during development to catch potential issues
early. When the attribute is set to *false*, warnings will not be propagated to
exceptions and will be returned with the query result.
There is also a server configuration option `--query.fail-on-warning` for setting the
default value for *failOnWarning* so it does not need to be set on a per-query level.

@RESTSTRUCT{stream,post_api_cursor_opts,boolean,optional,}
Specify *true* and the query will be executed in a **streaming** fashion. The query result is
not stored on the server, but calculated on the fly. *Beware*: long-running queries will
need to hold the collection locks for as long as the query cursor exists. 
When set to *false* a query will be executed right away in its entirety. 
In that case query results are either returned right away (if the result set is small enough),
or stored on the arangod instance and accessible via the cursor API (with respect to the `ttl`). 
It is advisable to *only* use this option on short-running queries or without exclusive locks 
(write-locks on MMFiles).
Please note that the query options `cache`, `count` and `fullCount` will not work on streaming queries.
Additionally query statistics, warnings and profiling data will only be available after the query is finished.
The default value is *false*

@RESTSTRUCT{optimizer.rules,post_api_cursor_opts,array,optional,string}
A list of to-be-included or to-be-excluded optimizer rules
can be put into this attribute, telling the optimizer to include or exclude
specific rules. To disable a rule, prefix its name with a `-`, to enable a rule, prefix it
with a `+`. There is also a pseudo-rule `all`, which will match all optimizer rules.

@RESTSTRUCT{profile,post_api_cursor_opts,integer,optional,}
If set to *true* or *1*, then the additional query profiling information will be returned
in the sub-attribute *profile* of the *extra* return attribute, if the query result
is not served from the query cache. Set to *2* the query will include execution stats
per query plan node in sub-attribute *stats.nodes* of the *extra* return attribute.
Additionally the query plan is returned in the sub-attribute *extra.plan*.

@RESTSTRUCT{satelliteSyncWait,post_api_cursor_opts,boolean,optional,}
This *Enterprise Edition* parameter allows to configure how long a DBServer will have time
to bring the satellite collections involved in the query into sync.
The default value is *60.0* (seconds). When the max time has been reached the query
will be stopped.

@RESTSTRUCT{maxTransactionSize,post_api_cursor_opts,integer,optional,int64}
Transaction size limit in bytes. Honored by the RocksDB storage engine only.

@RESTSTRUCT{intermediateCommitSize,post_api_cursor_opts,integer,optional,int64}
Maximum total size of operations after which an intermediate commit is performed
automatically. Honored by the RocksDB storage engine only.

@RESTSTRUCT{intermediateCommitCount,post_api_cursor_opts,integer,optional,int64}
Maximum number of operations after which an intermediate commit is performed
automatically. Honored by the RocksDB storage engine only.

@RESTSTRUCT{skipInaccessibleCollections,post_api_cursor_opts,boolean,optional,}
AQL queries (especially graph traversals) will treat collection to which a user has no access rights as if these collections were empty. Instead of returning a forbidden access error, your queries will execute normally. This is intended to help with certain use-cases: A graph contains several collections and different users execute AQL queries on that graph. You can now naturally limit the accessible results by changing the access rights of users on collections. This feature is only available in the Enterprise Edition.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
The query details include the query string plus optional query options and
bind parameters. These values need to be passed in a JSON representation in
the body of the POST request.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
is returned if the result set can be created by the server.

@RESTREPLYBODY{error,boolean,required,}
A flag to indicate that an error occurred (*false* in this case)

@RESTREPLYBODY{code,integer,required,integer}
the HTTP status code

@RESTREPLYBODY{result,array,optional,}
an array of result documents (might be empty if query has no results)

@RESTREPLYBODY{hasMore,boolean,required,}
A boolean indicator whether there are more results
available for the cursor on the server

@RESTREPLYBODY{count,integer,optional,int64}
the total number of result documents available (only
available if the query was executed with the *count* attribute set)

@RESTREPLYBODY{id,string,required,string}
id of temporary cursor created on the server (optional, see above)

@RESTREPLYBODY{extra,object,optional,}
an optional JSON object with extra information about the query result
contained in its *stats* sub-attribute. For data-modification queries, the
*extra.stats* sub-attribute will contain the number of modified documents and
the number of documents that could not be modified
due to an error (if *ignoreErrors* query option is specified)

@RESTREPLYBODY{cached,boolean,required,}
a boolean flag indicating whether the query result was served
from the query cache or not. If the query result is served from the query
cache, the *extra* return attribute will not contain any *stats* sub-attribute
and no *profile* sub-attribute.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if the JSON representation is malformed or the query specification is
missing from the request.

If the JSON representation is malformed or the query specification is
missing from the request, the server will respond with *HTTP 400*.

The body of the response will contain a JSON object with additional error
details. The object has the following attributes:

@RESTREPLYBODY{error,boolean,required,}
boolean flag to indicate that an error occurred (*true* in this case)

@RESTREPLYBODY{code,integer,required,int64}
the HTTP status code

@RESTREPLYBODY{errorNum,integer,required,int64}
the server error number

@RESTREPLYBODY{errorMessage,string,required,string}
a descriptive error message

If the query specification is complete, the server will process the query. If an
error occurs during query processing, the server will respond with *HTTP 400*.
Again, the body of the response will contain details about the error.

A [list of query errors can be found here](../../Manual/Appendix/ErrorCodes.html).


@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
The server will respond with *HTTP 404* in case a non-existing collection is
accessed in the query.

@RESTRETURNCODE{405}
The server will respond with *HTTP 405* if an unsupported HTTP method is used.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{ignoreRevs,boolean,optional}
By default, or if this is set to *true*, the *_rev* attributes in 
the given documents are ignored. If this is set to *false*, then
any *_rev* attribute given in a body document is taken as a
precondition. The document is only replaced if the current revision
is the one specified.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{returnOld,boolean,optional}
Return additionally the complete previous revision of the changed 
documents under the attribute *old* in the result.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{returnNew,boolean,optional}
Return additionally the complete new documents under the attribute *new*
in the result.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Replaces multiple documents in the specified collection with the
ones in the body, the replaced documents are specified by the *_key*
attributes in the body documents.

If *ignoreRevs* is *false* and there is a *_rev* attribute in a
document in the body and its value does not match the revision of
the corresponding document in the database, the precondition is
violated.

If the document exists and can be updated, then an *HTTP 201* or
an *HTTP 202* is returned (depending on *waitForSync*, see below).

Optionally, the query parameter *waitForSync* can be used to force
synchronization of the document replacement operation to disk even in case
that the *waitForSync* flag had been disabled for the entire collection.
Thus, the *waitForSync* query parameter can be used to force synchronization
of just specific operations. To use this, set the *waitForSync* parameter
to *true*. If the *waitForSync* parameter is not specified or set to
*false*, then the collection's default *waitForSync* behavior is
applied. The *waitForSync* query parameter cannot be used to disable
synchronization for collections that have a default *waitForSync* value
of *true*.

The body of the response contains a JSON array of the same length
as the input array with the information about the handle and the
revision of the replaced documents. In each entry, the attribute
*_id* contains the known *document-handle* of each updated document,
*_key* contains the key which uniquely identifies a document in a
given collection, and the attribute *_rev* contains the new document
revision. In case of an error or violated precondition, an error
object with the attribute *error* set to *true* and the attribute
*errorCode* set to the error code is built.

If the query parameter *returnOld* is *true*, then, for each
generated document, the complete previous revision of the document
is returned under the *old* attribute in the result.

If the query parameter *returnNew* is *true*, then, for each
generated document, the complete new document is returned under
the *new* attribute in the result.

Note that if any precondition is violated or an error occurred with
some of the documents, the return code is still 201 or 202, but
the additional HTTP header *X-Arango-Error-Codes* is set, which
contains a map of the error codes that occurred together with their
multiplicities, as in: *1200:17,1205:10* which means that in 17
cases the error 1200 "revision conflict" and in 10 cases the error
1205 "illegal document handle" has happened.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
is returned if the documents were replaced successfully and
*waitForSync* was *true*.

@RESTRETURNCODE{202}
is returned if the documents were replaced successfully and
*waitForSync* was *false*.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if the body does not contain a valid JSON representation
of an array of documents. The response body contains
an error document in this case.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
is returned if the collection was not found.

@brief removes multiple document

@RESTHEADER{DELETE /_api/document/{collection},Removes multiple documents, removeDocument}

@RESTALLBODYPARAM{array,json,required}
A JSON array of strings or documents.

@RESTURLPARAMETERS

@RESTURLPARAM{collection,string,required}
Collection from which documents are removed.

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{waitForSync,boolean,optional}
Wait until deletion operation has been synced to disk.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{returnOld,boolean,optional}
Return additionally the complete previous revision of the changed 
document under the attribute *old* in the result.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{ignoreRevs,boolean,optional}
If set to *true*, ignore any *_rev* attribute in the selectors. No
revision check is performed.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
The body of the request is an array consisting of selectors for
documents. A selector can either be a string with a key or a string
with a document handle or an object with a *_key* attribute. This
API call removes all specified documents from *collection*. If the
selector is an object and has a *_rev* attribute, it is a
precondition that the actual revision of the removed document in the
collection is the specified one.

The body of the response is an array of the same length as the input
array. For each input selector, the output contains a JSON object
with the information about the outcome of the operation. If no error
occurred, an object is built in which the attribute *_id* contains
the known *document-handle* of the removed document, *_key* contains
the key which uniquely identifies a document in a given collection,
and the attribute *_rev* contains the document revision. In case of
an error, an object with the attribute *error* set to *true* and
*errorCode* set to the error code is built.

If the *waitForSync* parameter is not specified or set to *false*,
then the collection's default *waitForSync* behavior is applied.
The *waitForSync* query parameter cannot be used to disable
synchronization for collections that have a default *waitForSync*
value of *true*.

If the query parameter *returnOld* is *true*, then
the complete previous revision of the document
is returned under the *old* attribute in the result.

Note that if any precondition is violated or an error occurred with
some of the documents, the return code is still 200 or 202, but
the additional HTTP header *X-Arango-Error-Codes* is set, which
contains a map of the error codes that occurred together with their
multiplicities, as in: *1200:17,1205:10* which means that in 17
cases the error 1200 "revision conflict" and in 10 cases the error
1205 "illegal document handle" has happened.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
is returned if *waitForSync* was *true*.

@RESTRETURNCODE{202}
is returned if *waitForSync* was *false*.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
is returned if the collection was not found.
The response body contains an error document in this case.

@startDocuBlock put_replace_document

@brief replaces a document

@RESTHEADER{PUT /_api/document/{document-handle},Replace document, replaceDocument}

@RESTALLBODYPARAM{document,json,required}
A JSON representation of a single document.

@RESTURLPARAMETERS

@RESTURLPARAM{document-handle,string,required}
This URL parameter must be a document handle.

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{waitForSync,boolean,optional}
Wait until document has been synced to disk.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{ignoreRevs,boolean,optional}
By default, or if this is set to *true*, the *_rev* attributes in 
the given document is ignored. If this is set to *false*, then
the *_rev* attribute given in the body document is taken as a
precondition. The document is only replaced if the current revision
is the one specified.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{returnOld,boolean,optional}
Return additionally the complete previous revision of the changed 
document under the attribute *old* in the result.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{returnNew,boolean,optional}
Return additionally the complete new document under the attribute *new*
in the result.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{silent,boolean,optional}
If set to *true*, an empty object will be returned as response. No meta-data 
will be returned for the replaced document. This option can be used to
save some network traffic.

@RESTHEADERPARAMETERS

@RESTHEADERPARAM{If-Match,string,optional}
You can conditionally replace a document based on a target revision id by
using the *if-match* HTTP header.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Replaces the document with handle <document-handle> with the one in
the body, provided there is such a document and no precondition is
violated.

If the *If-Match* header is specified and the revision of the
document in the database is unequal to the given revision, the
precondition is violated.

If *If-Match* is not given and *ignoreRevs* is *false* and there
is a *_rev* attribute in the body and its value does not match
the revision of the document in the database, the precondition is
violated.

If a precondition is violated, an *HTTP 412* is returned.

If the document exists and can be updated, then an *HTTP 201* or
an *HTTP 202* is returned (depending on *waitForSync*, see below),
the *Etag* header field contains the new revision of the document
and the *Location* header contains a complete URL under which the
document can be queried.

Optionally, the query parameter *waitForSync* can be used to force
synchronization of the document replacement operation to disk even in case
that the *waitForSync* flag had been disabled for the entire collection.
Thus, the *waitForSync* query parameter can be used to force synchronization
of just specific operations. To use this, set the *waitForSync* parameter
to *true*. If the *waitForSync* parameter is not specified or set to
*false*, then the collection's default *waitForSync* behavior is
applied. The *waitForSync* query parameter cannot be used to disable
synchronization for collections that have a default *waitForSync* value
of *true*.

If *silent* is not set to *true*, the body of the response contains a JSON 
object with the information about the handle and the revision. The attribute 
*_id* contains the known *document-handle* of the updated document, *_key* 
contains the key which uniquely identifies a document in a given collection, 
and the attribute *_rev* contains the new document revision.

If the query parameter *returnOld* is *true*, then
the complete previous revision of the document
is returned under the *old* attribute in the result.

If the query parameter *returnNew* is *true*, then
the complete new document is returned under
the *new* attribute in the result.

If the document does not exist, then a *HTTP 404* is returned and the
body of the response contains an error document.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
is returned if the document was replaced successfully and
*waitForSync* was *true*.

@RESTRETURNCODE{202}
is returned if the document was replaced successfully and
*waitForSync* was *false*.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if the body does not contain a valid JSON representation
of a document. The response body contains
an error document in this case.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
is returned if the collection or the document was not found.

@RESTRETURNCODE{412}
is returned if the precondition was violated. The response will
also contain the found documents' current revisions in the *_rev*
attributes. Additionally, the attributes *_id* and *_key* will be
returned.

@startDocuBlock post_create_document

@brief creates documents

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/document/{collection}, Create document, insertDocument}

@RESTURLPARAMETERS

@RESTURLPARAM{collection,string,required}
The *collection* in which the collection is to be created.

@RESTALLBODYPARAM{data,json,required}
A JSON representation of a single document or of an array of documents.

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{collection,string,optional}
The name of the collection. This is only for backward compatibility.
In ArangoDB versions < 3.0, the URL path was */_api/document* and
this query parameter was required. This combination still works, but
the recommended way is to specify the collection in the URL path.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{waitForSync,boolean,optional}
Wait until document has been synced to disk.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{returnNew,boolean,optional}
Additionally return the complete new document under the attribute *new*
in the result.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{returnOld,boolean,optional}
Additionally return the complete old document under the attribute *old*
in the result. Only available if the overwrite option is used.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{silent,boolean,optional}
If set to *true*, an empty object will be returned as response. No meta-data 
will be returned for the created document. This option can be used to
save some network traffic.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{overwrite,boolean,optional}
If set to *true*, the insert becomes a replace-insert. If a document with the
same *_key* already exists the new document is not rejected with unique
constraint violated but will replace the old document.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Creates a new document from the document given in the body, unless there
is already a document with the *_key* given. If no *_key* is given, a new
unique *_key* is generated automatically.

The body can be an array of documents, in which case all
documents in the array are inserted with the same semantics as for a
single document. The result body will contain a JSON array of the
same length as the input array, and each entry contains the result
of the operation for the corresponding input. In case of an error
the entry is a document with attributes *error* set to *true* and
errorCode set to the error code that has happened.

Possibly given *_id* and *_rev* attributes in the body are always ignored,
the URL part or the query parameter collection respectively counts.

If the document was created successfully, then the *Location* header
contains the path to the newly created document. The *Etag* header field
contains the revision of the document. Both are only set in the single
document case.

If *silent* is not set to *true*, the body of the response contains a 
JSON object (single document case) with the following attributes:

  - *_id* contains the document handle of the newly created document
  - *_key* contains the document key
  - *_rev* contains the document revision

In the multi case the body is an array of such objects.

If the collection parameter *waitForSync* is *false*, then the call
returns as soon as the document has been accepted. It will not wait
until the documents have been synced to disk.

Optionally, the query parameter *waitForSync* can be used to force
synchronization of the document creation operation to disk even in
case that the *waitForSync* flag had been disabled for the entire
collection. Thus, the *waitForSync* query parameter can be used to
force synchronization of just this specific operations. To use this,
set the *waitForSync* parameter to *true*. If the *waitForSync*
parameter is not specified or set to *false*, then the collection's
default *waitForSync* behavior is applied. The *waitForSync* query
parameter cannot be used to disable synchronization for collections
that have a default *waitForSync* value of *true*.

If the query parameter *returnNew* is *true*, then, for each
generated document, the complete new document is returned under
the *new* attribute in the result.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
is returned if the documents were created successfully and
*waitForSync* was *true*.

@RESTRETURNCODE{202}
is returned if the documents were created successfully and
*waitForSync* was *false*.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if the body does not contain a valid JSON representation
of one document or an array of documents. The response body contains
an error document in this case.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
is returned if the collection specified by *collection* is unknown.
The response body contains an error document in this case.

@RESTRETURNCODE{409}
is returned in the single document case if a document with the
same qualifiers in an indexed attribute conflicts with an already
existing document and thus violates that unique constraint. The
response body contains an error document in this case. In the array
case only 201 or 202 is returned, but if an error occurred, the
additional HTTP header *X-Arango-Error-Codes* is set, which
contains a map of the error codes that occurred together with their
multiplicities, as in: *1205:10,1210:17* which means that in 10
cases the error 1205 "illegal document handle" and in 17 cases the
error 1210 "unique constraint violated" has happened.

@EXAMPLES

Create a document in a collection named *products*. Note that the
revision identifier might or might not by equal to the auto-generated
key.

@startDocuBlock delete_remove_document

@brief removes a document

@RESTHEADER{DELETE /_api/document/{document-handle}, Removes a document, removeDocument}

@RESTURLPARAMETERS

@RESTURLPARAM{document-handle,string,required}
Removes the document identified by *document-handle*.

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{waitForSync,boolean,optional}
Wait until deletion operation has been synced to disk.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{returnOld,boolean,optional}
Return additionally the complete previous revision of the changed 
document under the attribute *old* in the result.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{silent,boolean,optional}
If set to *true*, an empty object will be returned as response. No meta-data 
will be returned for the removed document. This option can be used to
save some network traffic.

@RESTHEADERPARAMETERS

@RESTHEADERPARAM{If-Match,string,optional}
You can conditionally remove a document based on a target revision id by
using the *if-match* HTTP header.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
If *silent* is not set to *true*, the body of the response contains a JSON 
object with the information about the handle and the revision. The attribute 
*_id* contains the known *document-handle* of the removed document, *_key* 
contains the key which uniquely identifies a document in a given collection, 
and the attribute *_rev* contains the document revision.

If the *waitForSync* parameter is not specified or set to *false*,
then the collection's default *waitForSync* behavior is applied.
The *waitForSync* query parameter cannot be used to disable
synchronization for collections that have a default *waitForSync*
value of *true*.

If the query parameter *returnOld* is *true*, then
the complete previous revision of the document
is returned under the *old* attribute in the result.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
is returned if the document was removed successfully and
*waitForSync* was *true*.

@RESTRETURNCODE{202}
is returned if the document was removed successfully and
*waitForSync* was *false*.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
is returned if the collection or the document was not found.
The response body contains an error document in this case.

@RESTRETURNCODE{412}
is returned if a "If-Match" header or *rev* is given and the found
document has a different version. The response will also contain the found
document's current revision in the *_rev* attribute. Additionally, the
attributes *_id* and *_key* will be returned.

@startDocuBlock patch_update_document_MULTI

@brief updates multiple documents

@RESTHEADER{PATCH /_api/document/{collection},Update documents,updateDocument }

@RESTALLBODYPARAM{documents,json,required}
A JSON representation of an array of document updates as objects.

@RESTURLPARAMETERS

@RESTURLPARAM{collection,string,required}
This URL parameter is the name of the collection in which the
documents are updated.

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{keepNull,boolean,optional}
If the intention is to delete existing attributes with the patch
command, the URL query parameter *keepNull* can be used with a value
of *false*. This will modify the behavior of the patch command to
remove any attributes from the existing document that are contained
in the patch document with an attribute value of *null*.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{mergeObjects,boolean,optional}
Controls whether objects (not arrays) will be merged if present in
both the existing and the patch document. If set to *false*, the
value in the patch document will overwrite the existing document's
value. If set to *true*, objects will be merged. The default is
*true*.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{waitForSync,boolean,optional}
Wait until the new documents have been synced to disk.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{ignoreRevs,boolean,optional}
By default, or if this is set to *true*, the *_rev* attributes in 
the given documents are ignored. If this is set to *false*, then
any *_rev* attribute given in a body document is taken as a
precondition. The document is only updated if the current revision
is the one specified.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{returnOld,boolean,optional}
Return additionally the complete previous revision of the changed 
documents under the attribute *old* in the result.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{returnNew,boolean,optional}
Return additionally the complete new documents under the attribute *new*
in the result.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Partially updates documents, the documents to update are specified
by the *_key* attributes in the body objects. The body of the
request must contain a JSON array of document updates with the
attributes to patch (the patch documents). All attributes from the
patch documents will be added to the existing documents if they do
not yet exist, and overwritten in the existing documents if they do
exist there.

Setting an attribute value to *null* in the patch documents will cause a
value of *null* to be saved for the attribute by default.

If *ignoreRevs* is *false* and there is a *_rev* attribute in a
document in the body and its value does not match the revision of
the corresponding document in the database, the precondition is
violated.

If the document exists and can be updated, then an *HTTP 201* or
an *HTTP 202* is returned (depending on *waitForSync*, see below).

Optionally, the query parameter *waitForSync* can be used to force
synchronization of the document replacement operation to disk even in case
that the *waitForSync* flag had been disabled for the entire collection.
Thus, the *waitForSync* query parameter can be used to force synchronization
of just specific operations. To use this, set the *waitForSync* parameter
to *true*. If the *waitForSync* parameter is not specified or set to
*false*, then the collection's default *waitForSync* behavior is
applied. The *waitForSync* query parameter cannot be used to disable
synchronization for collections that have a default *waitForSync* value
of *true*.

The body of the response contains a JSON array of the same length
as the input array with the information about the handle and the
revision of the updated documents. In each entry, the attribute
*_id* contains the known *document-handle* of each updated document,
*_key* contains the key which uniquely identifies a document in a
given collection, and the attribute *_rev* contains the new document
revision. In case of an error or violated precondition, an error
object with the attribute *error* set to *true* and the attribute
*errorCode* set to the error code is built.

If the query parameter *returnOld* is *true*, then, for each
generated document, the complete previous revision of the document
is returned under the *old* attribute in the result.

If the query parameter *returnNew* is *true*, then, for each
generated document, the complete new document is returned under
the *new* attribute in the result.

Note that if any precondition is violated or an error occurred with
some of the documents, the return code is still 201 or 202, but
the additional HTTP header *X-Arango-Error-Codes* is set, which
contains a map of the error codes that occurred together with their
multiplicities, as in: *1200:17,1205:10* which means that in 17
cases the error 1200 "revision conflict" and in 10 cases the error
1205 "illegal document handle" has happened.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
is returned if the documents were updated successfully and
*waitForSync* was *true*.

@RESTRETURNCODE{202}
is returned if the documents were updated successfully and
*waitForSync* was *false*.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if the body does not contain a valid JSON representation
of an array of documents. The response body contains
an error document in this case.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
is returned if the collection was not found.

@startDocuBlock patch_update_document

@brief updates a document

@RESTHEADER{PATCH /_api/document/{document-handle},Update document, updateDocument}

@RESTALLBODYPARAM{document,json,required}
A JSON representation of a document update as an object.

@RESTURLPARAMETERS

@RESTURLPARAM{document-handle,string,required}
This URL parameter must be a document handle.

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{keepNull,boolean,optional}
If the intention is to delete existing attributes with the patch
command, the URL query parameter *keepNull* can be used with a value
of *false*. This will modify the behavior of the patch command to
remove any attributes from the existing document that are contained
in the patch document with an attribute value of *null*.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{mergeObjects,boolean,optional}
Controls whether objects (not arrays) will be merged if present in
both the existing and the patch document. If set to *false*, the
value in the patch document will overwrite the existing document's
value. If set to *true*, objects will be merged. The default is
*true*.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{waitForSync,boolean,optional}
Wait until document has been synced to disk.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{ignoreRevs,boolean,optional}
By default, or if this is set to *true*, the *_rev* attributes in 
the given document is ignored. If this is set to *false*, then
the *_rev* attribute given in the body document is taken as a
precondition. The document is only updated if the current revision
is the one specified.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{returnOld,boolean,optional}
Return additionally the complete previous revision of the changed 
document under the attribute *old* in the result.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{returnNew,boolean,optional}
Return additionally the complete new document under the attribute *new*
in the result.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{silent,boolean,optional}
If set to *true*, an empty object will be returned as response. No meta-data 
will be returned for the updated document. This option can be used to
save some network traffic.

@RESTHEADERPARAMETERS

@RESTHEADERPARAM{If-Match,string,optional}
You can conditionally update a document based on a target revision id by
using the *if-match* HTTP header.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Partially updates the document identified by *document-handle*.
The body of the request must contain a JSON document with the
attributes to patch (the patch document). All attributes from the
patch document will be added to the existing document if they do not
yet exist, and overwritten in the existing document if they do exist
there.

Setting an attribute value to *null* in the patch document will cause a
value of *null* to be saved for the attribute by default.

If the *If-Match* header is specified and the revision of the
document in the database is unequal to the given revision, the
precondition is violated.

If *If-Match* is not given and *ignoreRevs* is *false* and there
is a *_rev* attribute in the body and its value does not match
the revision of the document in the database, the precondition is
violated.

If a precondition is violated, an *HTTP 412* is returned.

If the document exists and can be updated, then an *HTTP 201* or
an *HTTP 202* is returned (depending on *waitForSync*, see below),
the *Etag* header field contains the new revision of the document
(in double quotes) and the *Location* header contains a complete URL
under which the document can be queried.

Optionally, the query parameter *waitForSync* can be used to force
synchronization of the updated document operation to disk even in case
that the *waitForSync* flag had been disabled for the entire collection.
Thus, the *waitForSync* query parameter can be used to force synchronization
of just specific operations. To use this, set the *waitForSync* parameter
to *true*. If the *waitForSync* parameter is not specified or set to
*false*, then the collection's default *waitForSync* behavior is
applied. The *waitForSync* query parameter cannot be used to disable
synchronization for collections that have a default *waitForSync* value
of *true*.

If *silent* is not set to *true*, the body of the response contains a JSON 
object with the information about the handle and the revision. The attribute 
*_id* contains the known *document-handle* of the updated document, *_key* 
contains the key which uniquely identifies a document in a given collection, 
and the attribute *_rev* contains the new document revision.

If the query parameter *returnOld* is *true*, then
the complete previous revision of the document
is returned under the *old* attribute in the result.

If the query parameter *returnNew* is *true*, then
the complete new document is returned under
the *new* attribute in the result.

If the document does not exist, then a *HTTP 404* is returned and the
body of the response contains an error document.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
is returned if the document was updated successfully and
*waitForSync* was *true*.

@RESTRETURNCODE{202}
is returned if the document was updated successfully and
*waitForSync* was *false*.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if the body does not contain a valid JSON representation
of a document. The response body contains
an error document in this case.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
is returned if the collection or the document was not found.

@RESTRETURNCODE{412}
is returned if the precondition was violated. The response will
also contain the found documents' current revisions in the *_rev*
attributes. Additionally, the attributes *_id* and *_key* will be
returned.

@startDocuBlock put_read_all_documents

@brief reads all documents from collection

@RESTHEADER{PUT /_api/simple/all-keys, Read all documents, allDocumentKeys}

@HINTS
{% hint 'warning' %}
This route should no longer be used.
All endpoints for Simple Queries are deprecated from version 3.4.0 on.
They are superseded by AQL queries.
{% endhint %}

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{collection,string,optional}
The name of the collection.
**This parameter is only for an easier migration path from old versions.**
In ArangoDB versions < 3.0, the URL path was `/_api/document` and
this was passed in via the query parameter "collection".
This combination was removed. The collection name can be passed to
`/_api/simple/all-keys` as body parameter (preferred) or as query parameter.

@RESTBODYPARAM{collection,string,required,}
The collection that should be queried

@RESTBODYPARAM{type,string,optional,}
The type of the result. The following values are allowed:

  - *id*: returns an array of document ids (*_id* attributes)
  - *key*: returns an array of document keys (*_key* attributes)
  - *path*: returns an array of document URI paths. This is the default.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Returns an array of all keys, ids, or URI paths for all documents in the
collection identified by *collection*. The type of the result array is
determined by the *type* attribute.

Note that the results have no defined order and thus the order should
not be relied on.

Note: the *all-keys* simple query is **deprecated** as of ArangoDB 3.4.0.
This API may get removed in future versions of ArangoDB. You can use the
`/_api/cursor` endpoint instead with one of the below AQL queries depending
on the desired result:

- `FOR doc IN @@collection RETURN doc._id` to mimic *type: id*
- `FOR doc IN @@collection RETURN doc._key` to mimic *type: key*
- `FOR doc IN @@collection RETURN CONCAT("/_db/", CURRENT_DATABASE(), "/_api/document/", doc._id)`
  to mimic *type: path*

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
All went well.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
The collection does not exist.

@EXAMPLES

@RESTURLPARAMETERS

@RESTURLPARAM{document-handle,string,required}
The handle of the document.

@RESTHEADERPARAMETERS

@RESTHEADERPARAM{If-None-Match,string,optional}
If the "If-None-Match" header is given, then it must contain exactly one
Etag. If the current document revision is not equal to the specified Etag,
an *HTTP 200* response is returned. If the current document revision is
identical to the specified Etag, then an *HTTP 304* is returned.

@RESTHEADERPARAM{If-Match,string,optional}
If the "If-Match" header is given, then it must contain exactly one
Etag. The document is returned, if it has the same revision as the
given Etag. Otherwise a *HTTP 412* is returned.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Like *GET*, but only returns the header fields and not the body. You
can use this call to get the current revision of a document or check if
the document was deleted.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
is returned if the document was found

@RESTRETURNCODE{304}
is returned if the "If-None-Match" header is given and the document has
the same version

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
is returned if the document or collection was not found

@RESTRETURNCODE{412}
is returned if an "If-Match" header is given and the found
document has a different version. The response will also contain the found
document's current revision in the *Etag* header.

@startDocuBlock get_api_collection_checksum

@brief returns a checksum for the specified collection

@RESTHEADER{GET /_api/collection/{collection-name}/checksum, Return checksum for the collection, handleCommandGet:collectionChecksum}

@HINTS
{% hint 'warning' %}
Accessing collections by their numeric ID is deprecated from version 3.4.0 on.
You should reference them via their names instead.
{% endhint %}

@RESTURLPARAMETERS

@RESTURLPARAM{collection-name,string,required}
The name of the collection.

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{withRevisions,boolean,optional}
Whether or not to include document revision ids in the checksum calculation.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{withData,boolean,optional}
Whether or not to include document body data in the checksum calculation.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Will calculate a checksum of the meta-data (keys and optionally revision ids) and
optionally the document data in the collection.

The checksum can be used to compare if two collections on different ArangoDB
instances contain the same contents. The current revision of the collection is
returned too so one can make sure the checksums are calculated for the same
state of data.

By default, the checksum will only be calculated on the *_key* system attribute
of the documents contained in the collection. For edge collections, the system
attributes *_from* and *_to* will also be included in the calculation.

By setting the optional query parameter *withRevisions* to *true*, then revision
ids (*_rev* system attributes) are included in the checksumming.

By providing the optional query parameter *withData* with a value of *true*,
the user-defined document attributes will be included in the calculation too.
**Note**: Including user-defined attributes will make the checksumming slower.

The response is a JSON object with the following attributes:

- *checksum*: The calculated checksum as a number.

- *revision*: The collection revision id as a string.

**Note**: this method is not available in a cluster.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
If the *collection-name* is missing, then a *HTTP 400* is
returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
If the *collection-name* is unknown, then a *HTTP 404*
is returned.

not for journals).

Saving new data in the collection subsequently will create a new journal file
automatically if there is no current journal.

It returns an object with the attributes

@startDocuBlock get_api_collection_shards

@brief Return the shard ids of a collection

@RESTHEADER{GET /_api/collection/{collection-name}/shards, Return the shard ids of a collection, shards:Collection}

@RESTURLPARAMETERS

@RESTURLPARAM{collection-name,string,required}
The name of the collection.

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{details,boolean,optional}
If set to true, the return value will also contain the responsible servers for the collections' shards.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
By default returns a JSON array with the shard IDs of the collection.

If the `details` parameter is set to `true`, it will return a JSON object with the
shard IDs as object attribute keys, and the responsible servers for each shard mapped to them.
In the detailed response, the leader shards will be first in the arrays.

**Note** : This method is only available in a cluster coordinator.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
Returns the collection's shards.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
If the *collection-name* is missing, then a *HTTP 400* is
returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
If the *collection-name* is unknown, then an *HTTP 404*
is returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{501}
*HTTP 501* is returned if the method is called on a single server.

@EXAMPLES

@startDocuBlock get_api_collection_figures

@brief Fetch the statistics of a collection

@RESTHEADER{GET /_api/collection/{collection-name}/figures, Return statistics for a collection, handleCommandGet:collectionFigures}

@HINTS
{% hint 'warning' %}
Accessing collections by their numeric ID is deprecated from version 3.4.0 on.
You should reference them via their names instead.
{% endhint %}

@RESTURLPARAMETERS

@RESTURLPARAM{collection-name,string,required}
The name of the collection.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
In addition to the above, the result also contains the number of documents
and additional statistical information about the collection.
**Note**: This will always load the collection into memory.

**Note**: collection data that is stored in the write-ahead log only is
not reported in the results. When the write-ahead log is collected, documents
might be added to journals and datafiles of the collection, which may modify
the figures of the collection.

Additionally, the filesizes of collection and index parameter JSON files are
not reported. These files should normally have a size of a few bytes
each. Please also note that the *fileSize* values are reported in bytes
and reflect the logical file sizes. Some filesystems may use optimizations
(e.g. sparse files) so that the actual physical file size is somewhat
different. Directories and sub-directories may also require space in the
file system, but this space is not reported in the *fileSize* results.

That means that the figures reported do not reflect the actual disk
usage of the collection with 100% accuracy. The actual disk usage of
a collection is normally slightly higher than the sum of the reported
*fileSize* values. Still the sum of the *fileSize* values can still be
used as a lower bound approximation of the disk usage.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
Returns information about the collection:

@RESTREPLYBODY{count,integer,required,int64}
The number of documents currently present in the collection.

@startDocuBlock put_api_collection_properties

@brief changes a collection

@RESTHEADER{PUT /_api/collection/{collection-name}/properties, Change properties of a collection, handleCommandPut:modifyProperties}

@HINTS
{% hint 'warning' %}
Accessing collections by their numeric ID is deprecated from version 3.4.0 on.
You should reference them via their names instead.
{% endhint %}

@RESTURLPARAMETERS

@RESTURLPARAM{collection-name,string,required}
The name of the collection.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Changes the properties of a collection. Expects an object with the
attribute(s)

- *waitForSync*: If *true* then creating or changing a
  document will wait until the data has been synchronized to disk.

- *journalSize*: The maximal size of a journal or datafile in bytes. 
  The value must be at least `1048576` (1 MB). Note that when
  changing the journalSize value, it will only have an effect for
  additional journals or datafiles that are created. Already
  existing journals or datafiles will not be affected.

On success an object with the following attributes is returned:

- *id*: The identifier of the collection.

- *name*: The name of the collection.

- *waitForSync*: The new value.

- *journalSize*: The new value.

- *status*: The status of the collection as number.

- *type*: The collection type. Valid types are:
  - 2: document collection
  - 3: edges collection

- *isSystem*: If *true* then the collection is a system collection.

- *isVolatile*: If *true* then the collection data will be
  kept in memory only and ArangoDB will not write or sync the data
  to disk.

- *doCompact*: Whether or not the collection will be compacted.

- *keyOptions*: JSON object which contains key generation options:
  - *type*: specifies the type of the key generator. The currently
    available generators are *traditional*, *autoincrement*, *uuid*
    and *padded*.
  - *allowUserKeys*: if set to *true*, then it is allowed to supply
    own key values in the *_key* attribute of a document. If set to
    *false*, then the key generator is solely responsible for
    generating keys and supplying own key values in the *_key* attribute
    of documents is considered an error.

**Note**: except for *waitForSync*, *journalSize* and *name*, collection
properties **cannot be changed** once a collection is created. To rename
a collection, the rename endpoint must be used.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
If the *collection-name* is missing, then a *HTTP 400* is
returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
If the *collection-name* is unknown, then a *HTTP 404*
is returned.

@brief Load Indexes into Memory

@RESTHEADER{PUT /_api/collection/{collection-name}/loadIndexesIntoMemory, Load Indexes into Memory, handleCommandPut:loadIndexes}

@HINTS
{% hint 'warning' %}
Accessing collections by their numeric ID is deprecated from version 3.4.0 on.
You should reference them via their names instead.
{% endhint %}

@RESTURLPARAMETERS

@RESTURLPARAM{collection-name,string,required}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
This route tries to cache all index entries
of this collection into the main memory.
Therefore it iterates over all indexes of the collection
and stores the indexed values, not the entire document data,
in memory.
All lookups that could be found in the cache are much faster
than lookups not stored in the cache so you get a nice performance boost.
It is also guaranteed that the cache is consistent with the stored data.

For the time being this function is only useful on RocksDB storage engine,
as in MMFiles engine all indexes are in memory anyways.

On RocksDB this function honors all memory limits, if the indexes you want
to load are smaller than your memory limit this function guarantees that most
index values are cached.
If the index is larger than your memory limit this function will fill up values
up to this limit and for the time being there is no way to control which indexes
of the collection should have priority over others.

On sucess this function returns an object with attribute `result` set to `true`

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
If the indexes have all been loaded

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
If the *collection-name* is missing, then a *HTTP 400* is
returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
If the *collection-name* is unknown, then a *HTTP 404* is returned.

@startDocuBlock post_api_collection

@brief creates a collection

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/collection, Create collection, handleCommandPost:CreateCollection}

@HINTS
{% hint 'warning' %}
Accessing collections by their numeric ID is deprecated from version 3.4.0 on.
You should reference them via their names instead.
{% endhint %}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Creates a new collection with a given name. The request must contain an
object with the following attributes.

@RESTBODYPARAM{name,string,required,string}
The name of the collection.

@RESTBODYPARAM{waitForSync,boolean,optional,}
If *true* then the data is synchronized to disk before returning from a
document create, update, replace or removal operation. (default: false)

@RESTBODYPARAM{doCompact,boolean,optional,}
whether or not the collection will be compacted (default is *true*)
This option is meaningful for the MMFiles storage engine only.

@RESTBODYPARAM{journalSize,integer,optional,int64}
The maximal size of a journal or datafile in bytes. The value
must be at least `1048576` (1 MiB). (The default is a configuration parameter)
This option is meaningful for the MMFiles storage engine only.

@RESTBODYPARAM{isSystem,boolean,optional,}
If *true*, create a  system collection. In this case *collection-name*
should start with an underscore. End users should normally create non-system
collections only. API implementors may be required to create system
collections in very special occasions, but normally a regular collection will do.
(The default is *false*)

@RESTBODYPARAM{isVolatile,boolean,optional,}
If *true* then the collection data is kept in-memory only and not made persistent.
Unloading the collection will cause the collection data to be discarded. Stopping
or re-starting the server will also cause full loss of data in the
collection. Setting this option will make the resulting collection be
slightly faster than regular collections because ArangoDB does not
enforce any synchronization to disk and does not calculate any CRC
checksums for datafiles (as there are no datafiles). This option
should therefore be used for cache-type collections only, and not
for data that cannot be re-created otherwise.
(The default is *false*)
This option is meaningful for the MMFiles storage engine only.

@RESTBODYPARAM{keyOptions,object,optional,post_api_collection_opts}
additional options for key generation. If specified, then *keyOptions*
should be a JSON array containing the following attributes:

@RESTSTRUCT{type,post_api_collection_opts,string,required,string}
specifies the type of the key generator. The currently available generators are
*traditional*, *autoincrement*, *uuid* and *padded*.

The *traditional* key generator generates numerical keys in ascending order.
The *autoincrement* key generator generates numerical keys in ascending order, 
the inital offset and the spacing can be configured
The *padded* key generator generates keys of a fixed length (16 bytes) in
ascending lexicographical sort order. This is ideal for usage with the _RocksDB_
engine, which will slightly benefit keys that are inserted in lexicographically
ascending order. The key generator can be used in a single-server or cluster.
The *uuid* key generator generates universally unique 128 bit keys, which 
are stored in hexadecimal human-readable format. This key generator can be used
in a single-server or cluster to generate "seemingly random" keys. The keys 
produced by this key generator are not lexicographically sorted.

@RESTSTRUCT{allowUserKeys,post_api_collection_opts,boolean,required,}
if set to *true*, then it is allowed to supply own key values in the
*_key* attribute of a document. If set to *false*, then the key generator
will solely be responsible for generating keys and supplying own key values
in the *_key* attribute of documents is considered an error.

@RESTSTRUCT{increment,post_api_collection_opts,integer,required,int64}
increment value for *autoincrement* key generator. Not used for other key
generator types.

@RESTSTRUCT{offset,post_api_collection_opts,integer,required,int64}
Initial offset value for *autoincrement* key generator.
Not used for other key generator types.

@RESTBODYPARAM{type,integer,optional,int64}
(The default is *2*): the type of the collection to create.
The following values for *type* are valid:

- *2*: document collection
- *3*: edge collection

@RESTBODYPARAM{indexBuckets,integer,optional,int64}
The number of buckets into which indexes using a hash
table are split. The default is 16 and this number has to be a
power of 2 and less than or equal to 1024.

For very large collections one should increase this to avoid long pauses
when the hash table has to be initially built or resized, since buckets
are resized individually and can be initially built in parallel. For
example, 64 might be a sensible value for a collection with 100
000 000 documents. Currently, only the edge index respects this
value, but other index types might follow in future ArangoDB versions.
Changes (see below) are applied when the collection is loaded the next
time.
This option is meaningful for the MMFiles storage engine only.

@RESTBODYPARAM{numberOfShards,integer,optional,int64}
(The default is *1*): in a cluster, this value determines the
number of shards to create for the collection. In a single
server setup, this option is meaningless.

@RESTBODYPARAM{shardKeys,string,optional,string}
(The default is *[ "_key" ]*): in a cluster, this attribute determines
which document attributes are used to determine the target shard for documents.
Documents are sent to shards based on the values of their shard key attributes.
The values of all shard key attributes in a document are hashed,
and the hash value is used to determine the target shard.
**Note**: Values of shard key attributes cannot be changed once set.
  This option is meaningless in a single server setup.

@RESTBODYPARAM{replicationFactor,integer,optional,int64}
(The default is *1*): in a cluster, this attribute determines how many copies
of each shard are kept on different DBServers. The value 1 means that only one
copy (no synchronous replication) is kept. A value of k means that k-1 replicas
are kept. Any two copies reside on different DBServers. Replication between them is 
synchronous, that is, every write operation to the "leader" copy will be replicated 
to all "follower" replicas, before the write operation is reported successful.

If a server fails, this is detected automatically and one of the servers holding 
copies take over, usually without an error being reported.

@RESTBODYPARAM{distributeShardsLike,string,optional,string}
(The default is *""*): in an Enterprise Edition cluster, this attribute binds
the specifics of sharding for the newly created collection to follow that of a
specified existing collection.
**Note**: Using this parameter has consequences for the prototype
collection. It can no longer be dropped, before the sharding-imitating
collections are dropped. Equally, backups and restores of imitating
collections alone will generate warnings (which can be overridden)
about missing sharding prototype.

@RESTBODYPARAM{shardingStrategy,string,optional,string}
This attribute specifies the name of the sharding strategy to use for 
the collection. Since ArangoDB 3.4 there are different sharding strategies 
to select from when creating a new collection. The selected *shardingStrategy* 
value will remain fixed for the collection and cannot be changed afterwards. 
This is important to make the collection keep its sharding settings and
always find documents already distributed to shards using the same
initial sharding algorithm.

The available sharding strategies are:
- `community-compat`: default sharding used by ArangoDB
  Community Edition before version 3.4
- `enterprise-compat`: default sharding used by ArangoDB
  Enterprise Edition before version 3.4
- `enterprise-smart-edge-compat`: default sharding used by smart edge
  collections in ArangoDB Enterprise Edition before version 3.4
- `hash`: default sharding used for new collections starting from version 3.4
  (excluding smart edge collections)
- `enterprise-hash-smart-edge`: default sharding used for new
  smart edge collections starting from version 3.4

If no sharding strategy is specified, the default will be *hash* for
all collections, and *enterprise-hash-smart-edge* for all smart edge
collections (requires the *Enterprise Edition* of ArangoDB). 
Manually overriding the sharding strategy does not yet provide a 
benefit, but it may later in case other sharding strategies are added.

@RESTBODYPARAM{smartJoinAttribute,string,optional,string}
In an *Enterprise Edition* cluster, this attribute determines an attribute
of the collection that must contain the shard key value of the referred-to 
smart join collection. Additionally, the shard key for a document in this 
collection must contain the value of this attribute, followed by a colon, 
followed by the actual primary key of the document.

This feature can only be used in the *Enterprise Edition* and requires the
*distributeShardsLike* attribute of the collection to be set to the name
of another collection. It also requires the *shardKeys* attribute of the
collection to be set to a single shard key attribute, with an additional ':'
at the end.
A further restriction is that whenever documents are stored or updated in the 
collection, the value stored in the *smartJoinAttribute* must be a string.

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{waitForSyncReplication,integer,optional}
Default is *1* which means the server will only report success back to the
client if all replicas have created the collection. Set to *0* if you want
faster server responses and don't care about full replication.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{enforceReplicationFactor,integer,optional}
Default is *1* which means the server will check if there are enough replicas
available at creation time and bail out otherwise. Set to *0* to disable
this extra check.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
If the *collection-name* is missing, then a *HTTP 400* is
returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
If the *collection-name* is unknown, then a *HTTP 404* is returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}

@RESTREPLYBODY{,object,required,collection_info}

@startDocuBlock post_api_index_hash

@brief creates a hash index

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/index#hash, Create hash index, createIndex:hash}

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{collection-name,string,required}
The collection name.

@RESTBODYPARAM{type,string,required,string}
must be equal to *"hash"*.

@RESTBODYPARAM{fields,array,required,string}
an array of attribute paths.

@RESTBODYPARAM{unique,boolean,required,}
if *true*, then create a unique index.

@RESTBODYPARAM{sparse,boolean,required,}
if *true*, then create a sparse index.

@RESTBODYPARAM{deduplicate,boolean,optional,boolean}
if *false*, the deduplication of array values is turned off.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
**NOTE** Swagger examples won't work due to the anchor.


Creates a hash index for the collection *collection-name* if it
does not already exist. The call expects an object containing the index
details.

In a sparse index all documents will be excluded from the index that do not 
contain at least one of the specified index attributes (i.e. *fields*) or that 
have a value of *null* in any of the specified index attributes. Such documents 
will not be indexed, and not be taken into account for uniqueness checks if
the *unique* flag is set.

In a non-sparse index, these documents will be indexed (for non-present
indexed attributes, a value of *null* will be used) and will be taken into
account for uniqueness checks if the *unique* flag is set.

**Note**: unique indexes on non-shard keys are not supported in a cluster.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
If the index already exists, then a *HTTP 200* is returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
If the index does not already exist and could be created, then a *HTTP 201*
is returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
If the collection already contains documents and you try to create a unique
hash index in such a way that there are documents violating the uniqueness,
then a *HTTP 400* is returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
If the *collection-name* is unknown, then a *HTTP 404* is returned.

@startDocuBlock post_api_index_geo

@brief creates a geo index

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/index#geo, Create geo-spatial index, createIndex#geo}

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{collection,string,required}
The collection name.


@RESTBODYPARAM{type,string,required,string}
must be equal to *"geo"*.

@RESTBODYPARAM{fields,array,required,string}
An array with one or two attribute paths.

If it is an array with one attribute path *location*, then a geo-spatial
index on all documents is created using *location* as path to the
coordinates. The value of the attribute must be an array with at least two
double values. The array must contain the latitude (first value) and the
longitude (second value). All documents, which do not have the attribute
path or with value that are not suitable, are ignored.

If it is an array with two attribute paths *latitude* and *longitude*,
then a geo-spatial index on all documents is created using *latitude*
and *longitude* as paths the latitude and the longitude. The value of
the attribute *latitude* and of the attribute *longitude* must a
double. All documents, which do not have the attribute paths or which
values are not suitable, are ignored.

@RESTBODYPARAM{geoJson,string,required,string}
If a geo-spatial index on a *location* is constructed
and *geoJson* is *true*, then the order within the array is longitude
followed by latitude. This corresponds to the format described in
http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html#positions

@RESTDESCRIPTION
**NOTE** Swagger examples won't work due to the anchor.


Creates a geo-spatial index in the collection *collection-name*, if
it does not already exist. Expects an object containing the index details.

Geo indexes are always sparse, meaning that documents that do not contain
the index attributes or have non-numeric values in the index attributes
will not be indexed.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
If the index already exists, then a *HTTP 200* is returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
If the index does not already exist and could be created, then a *HTTP 201*
is returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
If the *collection-name* is unknown, then a *HTTP 404* is returned.

The result is an object describing the index. It has at least the following
attributes:

- *id*: the identifier of the index

- *type*: the index type

All other attributes are type-dependent. For example, some indexes provide
*unique* or *sparse* flags, whereas others don't. Some indexes also provide 
a selectivity estimate in the *selectivityEstimate* attribute of the result.

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{collection-name,string,required}
The collection name.

@RESTBODYPARAM{type,string,required,string}
must be equal to *"fulltext"*.

@RESTBODYPARAM{fields,array,required,string}
an array of attribute names. Currently, the array is limited
to exactly one attribute.

@RESTBODYPARAM{minLength,integer,required,int64}
Minimum character length of words to index. Will default
to a server-defined value if unspecified. It is thus recommended to set
this value explicitly when creating the index.

**NOTE** Swagger examples won't work due to the anchor.


Creates a fulltext index for the collection *collection-name*, if
it does not already exist. The call expects an object containing the index
details.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
If the index already exists, then a *HTTP 200* is
returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
If the index does not already exist and could be created, then a *HTTP 201*
is returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}

@brief creates a persistent index

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/index#persistent, Create a persistent index, createIndex:persistent}

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{collection-name,string,required}
The collection name.

@RESTBODYPARAM{type,string,required,string}
must be equal to *"persistent"*.

@RESTBODYPARAM{fields,array,required,string}
an array of attribute paths.

@RESTBODYPARAM{unique,boolean,required,}
if *true*, then create a unique index.

@RESTBODYPARAM{sparse,boolean,required,}
if *true*, then create a sparse index.

@RESTDESCRIPTION

Creates a persistent index for the collection *collection-name*, if
it does not already exist. The call expects an object containing the index
details.

In a sparse index all documents will be excluded from the index that do not 
contain at least one of the specified index attributes (i.e. *fields*) or that 
have a value of *null* in any of the specified index attributes. Such documents 
will not be indexed, and not be taken into account for uniqueness checks if
the *unique* flag is set.

In a non-sparse index, these documents will be indexed (for non-present
indexed attributes, a value of *null* will be used) and will be taken into
account for uniqueness checks if the *unique* flag is set.

**Note**: unique indexes on non-shard keys are not supported in a cluster.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
If the index already exists, then a *HTTP 200* is
returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
If the index does not already exist and could be created, then a *HTTP 201*
is returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
If the collection already contains documents and you try to create a unique
persistent index in such a way that there are documents violating the
uniqueness, then a *HTTP 400* is returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
If the *collection-name* is unknown, then a *HTTP 404* is returned.

@startDocuBlock post_api_index

@brief creates an index

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/index#general, Create index, createIndex:general}

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{collection,string,required}
The collection name.

@RESTALLBODYPARAM{index-details,json,required}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
**NOTE** Swagger examples won't work due to the anchor.


Creates a new index in the collection *collection*. Expects
an object containing the index details.

The type of the index to be created must specified in the *type*
attribute of the index details. Depending on the index type, additional
other attributes may need to specified in the request in order to create
the index.

Indexes require the to be indexed attribute(s) in the *fields* attribute
of the index details. Depending on the index type, a single attribute or
multiple attributes can be indexed. In the latter case, an array of
strings is expected.

Indexing the system attribute *_id* is not supported for user-defined indexes. 
Manually creating an index using *_id* as an index attribute will fail with 
an error.

Optionally, an index name may be specified as a string in the *name* attribute.
Index names have the same restrictions as collection names. If no value is
specified, one will be auto-generated.

Some indexes can be created as unique or non-unique variants. Uniqueness
can be controlled for most indexes by specifying the *unique* flag in the
index details. Setting it to *true* will create a unique index.
Setting it to *false* or omitting the *unique* attribute will
create a non-unique index.

**Note**: The following index types do not support uniqueness, and using
the *unique* attribute with these types may lead to an error:

- geo indexes
- fulltext indexes

**Note**: Unique indexes on non-shard keys are not supported in a
cluster.

Hash, skiplist and persistent indexes can optionally be created in a sparse
variant. A sparse index will be created if the *sparse* attribute in
the index details is set to *true*. Sparse indexes do not index documents
for which any of the index attributes is either not set or is *null*. 

The optional attribute **deduplicate** is supported by array indexes of
type *hash* or *skiplist*. It controls whether inserting duplicate index values 
from the same document into a unique array index will lead to a unique constraint
error or not. The default value is *true*, so only a single instance of each
non-unique index value will be inserted into the index per document. Trying to
insert a value into the index that already exists in the index will always fail,
regardless of the value of this attribute.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
If the index already exists, then an *HTTP 200* is returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
If the index does not already exist and could be created, then an *HTTP 201*
is returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
If an invalid index description is posted or attributes are used that the
target index will not support, then an *HTTP 400* is returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
If *collection* is unknown, then an *HTTP 404* is returned.

@RESTBODYPARAM{unique,boolean,required,}
if *true*, then create a unique index.

@RESTBODYPARAM{sparse,boolean,required,}
if *true*, then create a sparse index.

@RESTBODYPARAM{deduplicate,boolean,optional,boolean}
if *false*, the deduplication of array values is turned off.

@RESTDESCRIPTION

Creates a skip-list index for the collection *collection-name*, if
it does not already exist. The call expects an object containing the index
details.

In a sparse index all documents will be excluded from the index that do not 
contain at least one of the specified index attributes (i.e. *fields*) or that 
have a value of *null* in any of the specified index attributes. Such documents 
will not be indexed, and not be taken into account for uniqueness checks if
the *unique* flag is set.

In a non-sparse index, these documents will be indexed (for non-present
indexed attributes, a value of *null* will be used) and will be taken into
account for uniqueness checks if the *unique* flag is set.

**Note**: unique indexes on non-shard keys are not supported in a cluster.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
If the index already exists, then a *HTTP 200* is
returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
If the index does not already exist and could be created, then a *HTTP 201*
is returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
If the collection already contains documents and you try to create a unique
skip-list index in such a way that there are documents violating the
uniqueness, then a *HTTP 400* is returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
If the *collection-name* is unknown, then a *HTTP 404* is returned.

@startDocuBlock post_api_view_arangosearch

@brief creates an ArangoSearch View

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/view#arangosearch, Create an ArangoSearch View, createView}

@RESTBODYPARAM{name,string,required,string}
The name of the View.

@RESTBODYPARAM{type,string,required,string}
The type of the View. Must be equal to *"arangosearch"*.
This option is immutable.

@RESTBODYPARAM{links,object,optional,}
Expects an object with the attribute keys being names of to be linked collections,
and the link properties as attribute values. See
[ArangoSearch View Link Properties](https://www.arangodb.com/docs/stable/arangosearch-views.html#link-properties)
for details.

@RESTBODYPARAM{primarySort,array,optional,object}
A primary sort order can be defined to enable an AQL optimization. If a query
iterates over all documents of a View, wants to sort them by attribute values
and the (left-most) fields to sort by as well as their sorting direction match
with the *primarySort* definition, then the `SORT` operation is optimized away.
This option is immutable.

Expects an array of objects, each specifying a field (attribute path) and a
sort direction (`"asc` for ascending, `"desc"` for descending):
`[ { "field": "attr", "direction": "asc"}, … ]`

@RESTBODYPARAM{cleanupIntervalStep,integer,optional,int64}
Wait at least this many commits between removing unused files in the
ArangoSearch data directory (default: 2, to disable use: 0).
For the case where the consolidation policies merge segments often (i.e. a lot
of commit+consolidate), a lower value will cause a lot of disk space to be
wasted.
For the case where the consolidation policies rarely merge segments (i.e. few
inserts/deletes), a higher value will impact performance without any added
benefits.<br/>
_Background:_
  With every "commit" or "consolidate" operation a new state of the View
  internal data-structures is created on disk.
  Old states/snapshots are released once there are no longer any users
  remaining.
  However, the files for the released states/snapshots are left on disk, and
  only removed by "cleanup" operation.

@RESTBODYPARAM{commitIntervalMsec,integer,optional,int64}
Wait at least this many milliseconds between committing View data store
changes and making documents visible to queries (default: 1000, to disable
use: 0).
For the case where there are a lot of inserts/updates, a lower value, until
commit, will cause the index not to account for them and memory usage would
continue to grow.
For the case where there are a few inserts/updates, a higher value will impact
performance and waste disk space for each commit call without any added
benefits.<br/>
_Background:_
  For data retrieval ArangoSearch Views follow the concept of
  "eventually-consistent", i.e. eventually all the data in ArangoDB will be
  matched by corresponding query expressions.
  The concept of ArangoSearch View "commit" operation is introduced to
  control the upper-bound on the time until document addition/removals are
  actually reflected by corresponding query expressions.
  Once a "commit" operation is complete all documents added/removed prior to
  the start of the "commit" operation will be reflected by queries invoked in
  subsequent ArangoDB transactions, in-progress ArangoDB transactions will
  still continue to return a repeatable-read state.

@RESTBODYPARAM{consolidationIntervalMsec,integer,optional,int64}
Wait at least this many milliseconds between applying 'consolidationPolicy' to
consolidate View data store and possibly release space on the filesystem
(default: 10000, to disable use: 0).
For the case where there are a lot of data modification operations, a higher
value could potentially have the data store consume more space and file handles.
For the case where there are a few data modification operations, a lower value
will impact performance due to no segment candidates available for
consolidation.<br/>
_Background:_
  For data modification ArangoSearch Views follow the concept of a
  "versioned data store". Thus old versions of data may be removed once there
  are no longer any users of the old data. The frequency of the cleanup and
  compaction operations are governed by 'consolidationIntervalMsec' and the
  candidates for compaction are selected via 'consolidationPolicy'.

@RESTBODYPARAM{consolidationPolicy,object,optional,}
The consolidation policy to apply for selecting which segments should be merged
(default: {})<br/>
_Background:_
  With each ArangoDB transaction that inserts documents one or more
  ArangoSearch internal segments gets created.
  Similarly for removed documents the segments that contain such documents
  will have these documents marked as 'deleted'.
  Over time this approach causes a lot of small and sparse segments to be
  created.
  A "consolidation" operation selects one or more segments and copies all of
  their valid documents into a single new segment, thereby allowing the
  search algorithm to perform more optimally and for extra file handles to be
  released once old segments are no longer used.<br/>
Sub-properties:
  - `type` (string, _optional_):
    The segment candidates for the "consolidation" operation are selected based
    upon several possible configurable formulas as defined by their types.
    The currently supported types are:
    - `"tier"` (default): consolidate based on segment byte size and live
      document count as dictated by the customization attributes. If this type
      is used, then below `segments*` and `minScore` properties are available.
    - `"bytes_accum"`: consolidate if and only if
      `{threshold} > (segment_bytes + sum_of_merge_candidate_segment_bytes) / all_segment_bytes`
      i.e. the sum of all candidate segment byte size is less than the total
      segment byte size multiplied by the `{threshold}`. If this type is used,
      then below `threshold` property is available.
  - `threshold` (number, _optional_): value in the range `[0.0, 1.0]`
  - `segmentsBytesFloor` (number, _optional_): Defines the value (in bytes) to
    treat all smaller segments as equal for consolidation selection
    (default: 2097152)
  - `segmentsBytesMax` (number, _optional_): Maximum allowed size of all
    consolidated segments in bytes (default: 5368709120)
  - `segmentsMax` (number, _optional_): The maximum number of segments that will
    be evaluated as candidates for consolidation (default: 10)
  - `segmentsMin` (number, _optional_): The minimum number of segments that will
    be evaluated as candidates for consolidation (default: 1)
  - `minScore` (number, _optional_): (default: 0)

@RESTBODYPARAM{writebufferIdle,integer,optional,int64}
Maximum number of writers (segments) cached in the pool
(default: 64, use 0 to disable, immutable)

@RESTBODYPARAM{writebufferActive,integer,optional,int64}
Maximum number of concurrent active writers (segments) that perform a
transaction. Other writers (segments) wait till current active writers
(segments) finish (default: 0, use 0 to disable, immutable)

@RESTBODYPARAM{writebufferSizeMax,integer,optional,int64}
Maximum memory byte size per writer (segment) before a writer (segment) flush
is triggered. `0` value turns off this limit for any writer (buffer) and data
will be flushed periodically based on the value defined for the flush thread
(ArangoDB server startup option). `0` value should be used carefully due to
high potential memory consumption
(default: 33554432, use 0 to disable, immutable)

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Creates a new View with a given name and properties if it does not
already exist.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
If the *name* or *type* attribute are missing or invalid, then an *HTTP 400*
error is returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{409}
If a View called *name* already exists, then an *HTTP 409* error is returned.

@RESTURLPARAMETERS

@RESTURLPARAM{view-name,string,required}
The name of the View.

@RESTBODYPARAM{links,object,optional,}
Expects an object with the attribute keys being names of to be linked collections,
and the link properties as attribute values. See
[ArangoSearch View Link Properties](https://www.arangodb.com/docs/stable/arangosearch-views.html#link-properties)
for details.

@RESTBODYPARAM{cleanupIntervalStep,integer,optional,int64}
Wait at least this many commits between removing unused files in the
ArangoSearch data directory (default: 2, to disable use: 0).
For the case where the consolidation policies merge segments often (i.e. a lot
of commit+consolidate), a lower value will cause a lot of disk space to be
wasted.
For the case where the consolidation policies rarely merge segments (i.e. few
inserts/deletes), a higher value will impact performance without any added
benefits.<br/>
_Background:_
  With every "commit" or "consolidate" operation a new state of the View
  internal data-structures is created on disk.
  Old states/snapshots are released once there are no longer any users
  remaining.
  However, the files for the released states/snapshots are left on disk, and
  only removed by "cleanup" operation.

@RESTBODYPARAM{commitIntervalMsec,integer,optional,int64}
Wait at least this many milliseconds between committing View data store
changes and making documents visible to queries (default: 1000, to disable
use: 0).
For the case where there are a lot of inserts/updates, a lower value, until
commit, will cause the index not to account for them and memory usage would
continue to grow.
For the case where there are a few inserts/updates, a higher value will impact
performance and waste disk space for each commit call without any added
benefits.<br/>

<!-- filename: /work/ArangoDB/Documentation/DocuBlocks/Rest/Graph Traversal/HTTP_API_TRAVERSAL.md -->
@startDocuBlock HTTP_API_TRAVERSAL

@brief execute a server-side traversal

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/traversal,executes a traversal}

@HINTS
{% hint 'warning' %}
This route should no longer be used.
It is considered as deprecated from version 3.4.0 on.
It is superseded by AQL graph traversal.
{% endhint %}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Starts a traversal starting from a given vertex and following.
edges contained in a given edgeCollection. The request must
contain the following attributes.

@RESTBODYPARAM{startVertex,string,required,string}
id of the startVertex, e.g. *"users/foo"*.

@RESTBODYPARAM{edgeCollection,string,optional, string}
name of the collection that contains the edges.

@RESTBODYPARAM{graphName,string,optional,string}
name of the graph that contains the edges.
Either *edgeCollection* or *graphName* has to be given.
In case both values are set the *graphName* is preferred.

@RESTBODYPARAM{filter,string,optional,string}
default is to include all nodes:
body (JavaScript code) of custom filter function
function signature: *(config, vertex, path) -> mixed*
can return four different string values:
- *"exclude"* -> this vertex will not be visited.
- *"prune"* -> the edges of this vertex will not be followed.
- *""* or *undefined* -> visit the vertex and follow its edges.
- *Array* -> containing any combination of the above.
  If there is at least one *"exclude"* or *"prune"* respectively
  is contained, it's effect will occur.

@RESTBODYPARAM{minDepth,string,optional,string}
ANDed with any existing filters):
visits only nodes in at least the given depth

@RESTBODYPARAM{maxDepth,string,optional,string}
ANDed with any existing filters visits only nodes in at most the given depth

@RESTBODYPARAM{visitor,string,optional,string}
body (JavaScript) code of custom visitor function
function signature: *(config, result, vertex, path, connected) -> void*
The visitor function can do anything, but its return value is ignored. To
populate a result, use the *result* variable by reference. Note that the
*connected* argument is only populated when the *order* attribute is set
to *"preorder-expander"*.

@RESTBODYPARAM{direction,string,optional,string}
direction for traversal
- *if set*, must be either *"outbound"*, *"inbound"*, or *"any"*
- *if not set*, the *expander* attribute must be specified

@RESTBODYPARAM{init,string,optional,string}
body (JavaScript) code of custom result initialization function
function signature: *(config, result) -> void*
initialize any values in result with what is required

@RESTBODYPARAM{expander,string,optional,string}
body (JavaScript) code of custom expander function
*must* be set if *direction* attribute is **not** set
function signature: *(config, vertex, path) -> array*
expander must return an array of the connections for *vertex*
each connection is an object with the attributes *edge* and *vertex*

@RESTBODYPARAM{sort,string,optional,string}
body (JavaScript) code of a custom comparison function
for the edges. The signature of this function is
*(l, r) -> integer* (where l and r are edges) and must
return -1 if l is smaller than, +1 if l is greater than,
and 0 if l and r are equal. The reason for this is the
following: The order of edges returned for a certain
vertex is undefined. This is because there is no natural
order of edges for a vertex with multiple connected edges.
To explicitly define the order in which edges on the
vertex are followed, you can specify an edge comparator
function with this attribute. Note that the value here has
to be a string to conform to the JSON standard, which in
turn is parsed as function body on the server side. Furthermore
note that this attribute is only used for the standard
expanders. If you use your custom expander you have to
do the sorting yourself within the expander code.

@RESTBODYPARAM{strategy,string,optional,string}
traversal strategy can be *"depthfirst"* or *"breadthfirst"*

@RESTBODYPARAM{order,string,optional,string}
traversal order can be *"preorder"*, *"postorder"* or *"preorder-expander"*

@RESTBODYPARAM{itemOrder,string,optional,string}
item iteration order can be *"forward"* or *"backward"*

@RESTBODYPARAM{uniqueness,string,optional,string}
specifies uniqueness for vertices and edges visited.
If set, must be an object like this:

`"uniqueness": {"vertices": "none"|"global"|"path", "edges": "none"|"global"|"path"}`

@RESTBODYPARAM{maxIterations,string,optional,string}
Maximum number of iterations in each traversal. This number can be
set to prevent endless loops in traversal of cyclic graphs. When a traversal performs
as many iterations as the *maxIterations* value, the traversal will abort with an
error. If *maxIterations* is not set, a server-defined value may be used.

@RESTDESCRIPTION

If the Traversal is successfully executed *HTTP 200* will be returned.
Additionally the *result* object will be returned by the traversal.

For successful traversals, the returned JSON object has the
following properties:

- *error*: boolean flag to indicate if an error occurred (*false*
  in this case)

- *code*: the HTTP status code

- *result*: the return value of the traversal

If the traversal specification is either missing or malformed, the server
will respond with *HTTP 400*.

The body of the response will then contain a JSON object with additional error
details. The object has the following attributes:

- *error*: boolean flag to indicate that an error occurred (*true* in this case)

- *code*: the HTTP status code

- *errorNum*: the server error number

- *errorMessage*: a descriptive error message

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
If the traversal is fully executed
*HTTP 200* will be returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
If the traversal specification is either missing or malformed, the server
will respond with *HTTP 400*.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
The server will responded with *HTTP 404* if the specified edge collection
does not exist, or the specified start vertex cannot be found.

@RESTRETURNCODE{500}
The server will responded with *HTTP 500* when an error occurs inside the
traversal or if a traversal performs more than *maxIterations* iterations.

@EXAMPLES

In the following examples the underlying graph will contain five persons
*Alice*, *Bob*, *Charlie*, *Dave* and *Eve*.
We will have the following directed relations:

- *Alice* knows *Bob*
- *Bob* knows *Charlie*
- *Bob* knows *Dave*
- *Eve* knows *Alice*
- *Eve* knows *Bob*

The starting vertex will always be Alice.

Follow only outbound edges

@RESTHEADER{PUT /_admin/wal/flush, Flushes the write-ahead log, RestWalHandler:flush}

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{waitForSync,boolean,optional}
Whether or not the operation should block until the not-yet synchronized
data in the write-ahead log was synchronized to disk.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{waitForCollector,boolean,optional}
Whether or not the operation should block until the data in the flushed
log has been collected by the write-ahead log garbage collector. Note that
setting this option to *true* might block for a long time if there are
long-running transactions and the write-ahead log garbage collector cannot
finish garbage collection.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Flushes the write-ahead log. By flushing the currently active write-ahead
logfile, the data in it can be transferred to collection journals and
datafiles. This is useful to ensure that all data for a collection is
present in the collection journals and datafiles, for example, when dumping
the data of a collection.

@RESTURLPARAM{transaction-id,string,required}
The transaction identifier,

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Commit a running server-side transaction. Committing is an idempotent operation. 
It is not an error to commit a transaction more than once.

If the transaction can be committed, *HTTP 200* will be returned. 
The returned JSON object has the following properties:

- *error*: boolean flag to indicate if an error occurred (*false*
  in this case)

- *code*: the HTTP status code

- *result*: result containing
    - *id*: the identifier of the transaction
    - *status*: containing the string 'committed'

If the transaction cannot be found, committing is not allowed or the 
transaction was aborted, the server
will respond with *HTTP 400*, *HTTP 404* or *HTTP 409*.

The body of the response will then contain a JSON object with additional error
details. The object has the following attributes:

- *error*: boolean flag to indicate that an error occurred (*true* in this case)

- *code*: the HTTP status code

- *errorNum*: the server error number

- *errorMessage*: a descriptive error message


@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}

@brief execute a server-side transaction

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/transaction, Execute transaction, executeCommit}

@RESTBODYPARAM{collections,string,required,string}
*collections* must be a JSON object that can have one or all sub-attributes
*read*, *write* or *exclusive*, each being an array of collection names or a
single collection name as string. Collections that will be written to in the
transaction must be declared with the *write* or *exclusive* attribute or it
will fail, whereas non-declared collections from which is solely read will be
added lazily. The optional sub-attribute *allowImplicit* can be set to *false*
to let transactions fail in case of undeclared collections for reading.
Collections for reading should be fully declared if possible, to avoid
deadlocks.
See [locking and isolation](../../Manual/Transactions/LockingAndIsolation.html)
for more information.

@RESTBODYPARAM{action,string,required,string}
the actual transaction operations to be executed, in the
form of stringified JavaScript code. The code will be executed on server
side, with late binding. It is thus critical that the code specified in
*action* properly sets up all the variables it needs.
If the code specified in *action* ends with a return statement, the
value returned will also be returned by the REST API in the *result*
attribute if the transaction committed successfully.

@RESTBODYPARAM{waitForSync,boolean,optional,boolean}
an optional boolean flag that, if set, will force the
transaction to write all data to disk before returning.

@RESTBODYPARAM{allowImplicit,boolean,optional,boolean}
Allow reading from undeclared collections.

@RESTBODYPARAM{lockTimeout,integer,optional,int64}
an optional numeric value that can be used to set a
timeout for waiting on collection locks. If not specified, a default
value will be used. Setting *lockTimeout* to *0* will make ArangoDB
not time out waiting for a lock.

@RESTBODYPARAM{params,string,optional,string}
optional arguments passed to *action*.

@RESTBODYPARAM{maxTransactionSize,integer,optional,int64}
Transaction size limit in bytes. Honored by the RocksDB storage engine only.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
The transaction description must be passed in the body of the POST request.

If the transaction is fully executed and committed on the server,
*HTTP 200* will be returned. Additionally, the return value of the
code defined in *action* will be returned in the *result* attribute.

For successfully committed transactions, the returned JSON object has the
following properties:

- *error*: boolean flag to indicate if an error occurred (*false*
  in this case)

- *code*: the HTTP status code

- *result*: the return value of the transaction

If the transaction specification is either missing or malformed, the server
will respond with *HTTP 400*.

The body of the response will then contain a JSON object with additional error
details. The object has the following attributes:

- *error*: boolean flag to indicate that an error occurred (*true* in this case)

- *code*: the HTTP status code

- *errorNum*: the server error number

- *errorMessage*: a descriptive error message

If a transaction fails to commit, either by an exception thrown in the
*action* code, or by an internal error, the server will respond with
an error.
Any other errors will be returned with any of the return codes
*HTTP 400*, *HTTP 409*, or *HTTP 500*.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
If the transaction is fully executed and committed on the server,
*HTTP 200* will be returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
If the transaction specification is either missing or malformed, the server
will respond with *HTTP 400*.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
If the transaction specification contains an unknown collection, the server
will respond with *HTTP 404*.

@RESTRETURNCODE{500}
Exceptions thrown by users will make the server respond with a return code of
*HTTP 500*

@startDocuBlock post_api_transaction_begin

@brief begin a server-side transaction

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/transaction/begin, Begin transaction, executeBegin}

@RESTBODYPARAM{collections,string,required,string}
*collections* must be a JSON object that can have one or all sub-attributes
*read*, *write* or *exclusive*, each being an array of collection names or a
single collection name as string. Collections that will be written to in the
transaction must be declared with the *write* or *exclusive* attribute or it
will fail, whereas non-declared collections from which is solely read will be
added lazily. The optional sub-attribute *allowImplicit* can be set to *false*
to let transactions fail in case of undeclared collections for reading.
Collections for reading should be fully declared if possible, to avoid
deadlocks.
See [locking and isolation](../../Manual/Transactions/LockingAndIsolation.html)
for more information.

@RESTBODYPARAM{waitForSync,boolean,optional,boolean}
an optional boolean flag that, if set, will force the
transaction to write all data to disk before returning.

@RESTBODYPARAM{allowImplicit,boolean,optional,boolean}
Allow reading from undeclared collections.

@RESTBODYPARAM{lockTimeout,integer,optional,int64}
an optional numeric value that can be used to set a
timeout for waiting on collection locks. If not specified, a default
value will be used. Setting *lockTimeout* to *0* will make ArangoDB
not time out waiting for a lock.

@RESTBODYPARAM{maxTransactionSize,integer,optional,int64}
Transaction size limit in bytes. Honored by the RocksDB storage engine only.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
The transaction description must be passed in the body of the POST request.
If the transaction can be started on the server, *HTTP 201* will be returned. 

For successfully started transactions, the returned JSON object has the
following properties:

- *error*: boolean flag to indicate if an error occurred (*false*
  in this case)

- *code*: the HTTP status code

- *result*: result containing
    - *id*: the identifier of the transaction
    - *status*: containing the string 'running'

If the transaction specification is either missing or malformed, the server
will respond with *HTTP 400* or *HTTP 404*.

The body of the response will then contain a JSON object with additional error
details. The object has the following attributes:

- *error*: boolean flag to indicate that an error occurred (*true* in this case)

- *code*: the HTTP status code

- *errorNum*: the server error number

- *errorMessage*: a descriptive error message


@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
If the transaction is running on the server,
*HTTP 201* will be returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
If the transaction specification is either missing or malformed, the server
will respond with *HTTP 400*.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
If the transaction specification contains an unknown collection, the server
will respond with *HTTP 404*.

@startDocuBlock RestRemoveByKeys

@brief removes multiple documents by their keys

@RESTHEADER{PUT /_api/simple/remove-by-keys, Remove documents by their keys}

@HINTS
{% hint 'warning' %}
This route should no longer be used.
All endpoints for Simple Queries are deprecated from version 3.4.0 on.
They are superseded by AQL queries.
{% endhint %}

@RESTBODYPARAM{collection,string,required,string}
The name of the collection to look in for the documents to remove

@RESTBODYPARAM{keys,array,required,string}
array with the _keys of documents to remove.

@RESTBODYPARAM{options,object,optional,put_api_simple_remove_by_keys_opts}
a json object which can contains following attributes:

@RESTSTRUCT{waitForSync,put_api_simple_remove_by_keys_opts,boolean,optional,}
if set to true, then all removal operations will
instantly be synchronized to disk. If this is not specified, then the
collection's default sync behavior will be applied.

@RESTSTRUCT{silent,put_api_simple_remove_by_keys_opts,boolean,optional,}
if set to *false*, then the result will contain an additional
attribute *old* which contains an array with one entry for each
removed document. By default, these entries will have the *_id*,
*_key* and *_rev* attributes.

@RESTSTRUCT{returnOld,put_api_simple_remove_by_keys_opts,boolean,optional,}
if set to *true* and *silent* above is *false*, then the above
information about the removed documents contains the complete
removed documents.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Looks up the documents in the specified collection using the array of keys
provided, and removes all documents from the collection whose keys are
contained in the *keys* array. Keys for which no document can be found in
the underlying collection are ignored, and no exception will be thrown for
them.

Equivalent AQL query (the RETURN clause is optional):

    FOR key IN @keys REMOVE key IN @@collection
      RETURN OLD

The body of the response contains a JSON object with information how many
documents were removed (and how many were not). The *removed* attribute will
contain the number of actually removed documents. The *ignored* attribute 
will contain the number of keys in the request for which no matching document
could be found.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
is returned if the operation was carried out successfully. The number of removed
documents may still be 0 in this case if none of the specified document keys
were found in the collection.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
is returned if the collection was not found.
The response body contains an error document in this case.

@RESTRETURNCODE{405}
is returned if the operation was called with a different HTTP METHOD than PUT.

@startDocuBlock put_api_simple_range

@brief returns all documents of a collection within a range

@RESTHEADER{PUT /_api/simple/range, Simple range query}

@HINTS
{% hint 'warning' %}
This route should no longer be used.
All endpoints for Simple Queries are deprecated from version 3.4.0 on.
They are superseded by AQL queries.
{% endhint %}

@RESTBODYPARAM{collection,string,required,string}
The name of the collection to query.

@RESTBODYPARAM{attribute,string,required,string}
The attribute path to check.

@RESTBODYPARAM{left,string,required,string}
The lower bound.

@RESTBODYPARAM{right,string,required,string}
The upper bound.

@RESTBODYPARAM{closed,boolean,required,}
If *true*, use interval including *left* and *right*,
otherwise exclude *right*, but include *left*.

@RESTBODYPARAM{skip,string,required,string}
The number of documents to skip in the query (optional).

@RESTBODYPARAM{limit,integer,optional,int64}
The maximal amount of documents to return. The *skip*
is applied before the *limit* restriction. (optional)

@RESTDESCRIPTION

This will find all documents within a given range. In order to execute a
range query, a skip-list index on the queried attribute must be present.

Returns a cursor containing the result, see [HTTP Cursor](../AqlQueryCursor/README.md) for details.

Note: the *range* simple query is **deprecated** as of ArangoDB 2.6. 
The function may be removed in future versions of ArangoDB. The preferred
way for retrieving documents from a collection within a specific range
is to use an AQL query as follows: 

    FOR doc IN @@collection 
      FILTER doc.value >= @left && doc.value < @right 
      LIMIT @skip, @limit 
      RETURN doc`

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
is returned if the query was executed successfully.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if the body does not contain a valid JSON representation of a
query. The response body contains an error document in this case.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
is returned if the collection specified by *collection* is unknown or no
suitable index for the range query is present.  The response body contains 
an error document in this case.

@startDocuBlock put_api_simple_update_by_example

@brief partially updates the body of all documents of a collection that match an example

@RESTHEADER{PUT /_api/simple/update-by-example, Update documents by example}

@HINTS
{% hint 'warning' %}
This route should no longer be used.
All endpoints for Simple Queries are deprecated from version 3.4.0 on.
They are superseded by AQL queries.
{% endhint %}

@RESTBODYPARAM{collection,string,required,string}
The name of the collection to update within.

@RESTBODYPARAM{example,string,required,string}
An example document that all collection documents are compared against.

@RESTBODYPARAM{newValue,object,required,}
A document containing all the attributes to update in the found documents.

@RESTBODYPARAM{options,object,optional,put_api_simple_update_by_example_options}
a json object which can contains following attributes:

@RESTSTRUCT{keepNull,put_api_simple_update_by_example_options,boolean,optional,}
This parameter can be used to modify the behavior when
handling *null* values. Normally, *null* values are stored in the
database. By setting the *keepNull* parameter to *false*, this
behavior can be changed so that all attributes in *data* with *null*
values will be removed from the updated document.

@RESTSTRUCT{waitForSync,put_api_simple_update_by_example_options,boolean,optional,}
if set to true, then all removal operations will
instantly be synchronized to disk. If this is not specified, then the
collection's default sync behavior will be applied.

@RESTSTRUCT{limit,put_api_simple_update_by_example_options,integer,optional,int64}
an optional value that determines how many documents to
update at most. If *limit* is specified but is less than the number
of documents in the collection, it is undefined which of the documents
will be updated.

@RESTSTRUCT{mergeObjects,put_api_simple_update_by_example_options,boolean,optional,}
Controls whether objects (not arrays) will be merged if present in both the
existing and the patch document. If set to false, the value in the
patch document will overwrite the existing document's value. If set to
true, objects will be merged. The default is true.

@RESTDESCRIPTION

This will find all documents in the collection that match the specified
example object, and partially update the document body with the new value
specified. Note that document meta-attributes such as *_id*, *_key*,
*_from*, *_to* etc. cannot be replaced.

Note: the *limit* attribute is not supported on sharded collections.
Using it will result in an error.

Returns the number of documents that were updated.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
is returned if the collection was updated successfully and *waitForSync* was
*true*.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if the body does not contain a valid JSON representation of a
query. The response body contains an error document in this case.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
is returned if the collection specified by *collection* is unknown.  The
response body contains an error document in this case.

@startDocuBlock put_api_simple_first_example

@brief returns one document of a collection matching a given example

@RESTHEADER{PUT /_api/simple/first-example, Find documents matching an example}

@HINTS
{% hint 'warning' %}
This route should no longer be used.
All endpoints for Simple Queries are deprecated from version 3.4.0 on.
They are superseded by AQL queries.
{% endhint %}

{% hint 'warning' %}
Till ArangoDB versions 3.2.13 and 3.3.7 this API is quite expensive.
A more lightweight alternative is to use the [HTTP Cursor API](../AqlQueryCursor/README.md).
Starting from versions 3.2.14 and 3.3.8 this performance impact is not
an issue anymore, as the internal implementation of the API has changed.
{% endhint %}

@RESTBODYPARAM{collection,string,required,string}
The name of the collection to query.

@RESTBODYPARAM{example,string,required,string}
The example document.

@RESTDESCRIPTION

This will return the first document matching a given example.

Returns a result containing the document or *HTTP 404* if no
document matched the example.

If more than one document in the collection matches the specified example, only
one of these documents will be returned, and it is undefined which of the matching
documents is returned.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
is returned when the query was successfully executed.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if the body does not contain a valid JSON representation of a
query. The response body contains an error document in this case.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
is returned if the collection specified by *collection* is unknown.  The
response body contains an error document in this case.

@EXAMPLES

@startDocuBlock RestLookupByKeys

@brief fetches multiple documents by their keys

@RESTHEADER{PUT /_api/simple/lookup-by-keys, Find documents by their keys}

@HINTS
{% hint 'warning' %}
This route should no longer be used.
All endpoints for Simple Queries are deprecated from version 3.4.0 on.
They are superseded by AQL queries.
{% endhint %}

@RESTBODYPARAM{collection,string,required,string}
The name of the collection to look in for the documents

@RESTBODYPARAM{keys,array,required,string}
array with the _keys of documents to remove.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Looks up the documents in the specified collection
using the array of keys provided. All documents for which a matching
key was specified in the *keys* array and that exist in the collection
will be returned.  Keys for which no document can be found in the
underlying collection are ignored, and no exception will be thrown for
them.

Equivalent AQL query:

    FOR doc IN @@collection FILTER doc._key IN @keys RETURN doc

The body of the response contains a JSON object with a *documents*
attribute. The *documents* attribute is an array containing the
matching documents. The order in which matching documents are present
in the result array is unspecified.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
is returned if the operation was carried out successfully.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
is returned if the collection was not found.  The response body
contains an error document in this case.

@RESTRETURNCODE{405}
is returned if the operation was called with a different HTTP METHOD than PUT.

@startDocuBlock put_api_simple_within

@brief returns all documents of a collection within a given radius

@RESTHEADER{PUT /_api/simple/within, Find documents within a radius around a coordinate}

@HINTS
{% hint 'warning' %}
This route should no longer be used.
All endpoints for Simple Queries are deprecated from version 3.4.0 on.
They are superseded by AQL queries.
{% endhint %}

@RESTBODYPARAM{collection,string,required,string}
The name of the collection to query.

@RESTBODYPARAM{latitude,string,required,string}
The latitude of the coordinate.

@RESTBODYPARAM{longitude,string,required,string}
The longitude of the coordinate.

@RESTBODYPARAM{radius,string,required,string}
The maximal radius (in meters).

@RESTBODYPARAM{distance,string,required,string}
If given, the attribute key used to return the distance to
the given coordinate. (optional). If specified, distances are returned in meters.

@RESTBODYPARAM{skip,string,required,string}
The number of documents to skip in the query. (optional)

@RESTBODYPARAM{limit,string,required,string}
The maximal amount of documents to return. The *skip* is
applied before the *limit* restriction. The default is 100. (optional)

@RESTBODYPARAM{geo,string,required,string}
If given, the identifier of the geo-index to use. (optional)

@RESTDESCRIPTION

This will find all documents within a given radius around the coordinate
(*latitude*, *longitude*). The returned list is sorted by distance.

In order to use the *within* operator, a geo index must be defined for
the collection. This index also defines which attribute holds the
coordinates for the document.  If you have more than one geo-spatial index,
you can use the *geo* field to select a particular index.


Returns a cursor containing the result, see [HTTP Cursor](../AqlQueryCursor/README.md) for details.

Note: the *within* simple query is **deprecated** as of ArangoDB 2.6. 
This API may be removed in future versions of ArangoDB. The preferred
way for retrieving documents from a collection using the near operator is
to issue an [AQL query](../../AQL/Functions/Geo.html) using the *WITHIN* function as follows: 

    FOR doc IN WITHIN(@@collection, @latitude, @longitude, @radius, @distanceAttributeName)
      RETURN doc

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
is returned if the query was executed successfully.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if the body does not contain a valid JSON representation of a
query. The response body contains an error document in this case.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
is returned if the collection specified by *collection* is unknown.  The
response body contains an error document in this case.

@startDocuBlock put_api_simple_near

@brief returns all documents of a collection near a given location

@RESTHEADER{PUT /_api/simple/near, Returns documents near a coordinate}

@HINTS
{% hint 'warning' %}
This route should no longer be used.
All endpoints for Simple Queries are deprecated from version 3.4.0 on.
They are superseded by AQL queries.
{% endhint %}

@RESTBODYPARAM{collection,string,required,string}
The name of the collection to query.

@RESTBODYPARAM{latitude,string,required,string}
The latitude of the coordinate.

@RESTBODYPARAM{longitude,string,required,string}
The longitude of the coordinate.

@RESTBODYPARAM{distance,string,required,string}
If given, the attribute key used to return the distance to
the given coordinate. (optional). If specified, distances are returned in meters.

@RESTBODYPARAM{skip,string,required,string}
The number of documents to skip in the query. (optional)

@RESTBODYPARAM{limit,string,required,string}
The maximal amount of documents to return. The *skip* is
applied before the *limit* restriction. The default is 100. (optional)

@RESTBODYPARAM{geo,string,required,string}
If given, the identifier of the geo-index to use. (optional)

@RESTDESCRIPTION

The default will find at most 100 documents near the given coordinate.  The
returned array is sorted according to the distance, with the nearest document
being first in the return array. If there are near documents of equal distance, documents
are chosen randomly from this set until the limit is reached.

In order to use the *near* operator, a geo index must be defined for the
collection. This index also defines which attribute holds the coordinates
for the document.  If you have more than one geo-spatial index, you can use
the *geo* field to select a particular index.


Returns a cursor containing the result, see [HTTP Cursor](../AqlQueryCursor/README.md) for details.

Note: the *near* simple query is **deprecated** as of ArangoDB 2.6. 
This API may be removed in future versions of ArangoDB. The preferred
way for retrieving documents from a collection using the near operator is
to issue an [AQL query](../../AQL/Functions/Geo.html) using the *NEAR* function as follows: 

    FOR doc IN NEAR(@@collection, @latitude, @longitude, @limit)
      RETURN doc`

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
is returned if the query was executed successfully.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if the body does not contain a valid JSON representation of a
query. The response body contains an error document in this case.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
is returned if the collection specified by *collection* is unknown.  The
response body contains an error document in this case.

@startDocuBlock put_api_simple_by_example

@brief returns all documents of a collection matching a given example

@RESTHEADER{PUT /_api/simple/by-example, Simple query by-example}

@HINTS
{% hint 'warning' %}
This route should no longer be used.
All endpoints for Simple Queries are deprecated from version 3.4.0 on.
They are superseded by AQL queries.
{% endhint %}

{% hint 'warning' %}
Till ArangoDB versions 3.2.13 and 3.3.7 this API is quite expensive.
A more lightweight alternative is to use the [HTTP Cursor API](../AqlQueryCursor/README.md).
Starting from versions 3.2.14 and 3.3.8 this performance impact is not
an issue anymore, as the internal implementation of the API has changed.
{% endhint %}

@RESTBODYPARAM{collection,string,required,string}
The name of the collection to query.

@RESTBODYPARAM{example,string,required,string}
The example document.

@RESTBODYPARAM{skip,string,required,string}
The number of documents to skip in the query (optional).

@RESTBODYPARAM{limit,string,required,string}
The maximal amount of documents to return. The *skip*
is applied before the *limit* restriction. (optional)

@RESTBODYPARAM{batchSize,integer,optional,int64}
maximum number of result documents to be transferred from
the server to the client in one roundtrip. If this attribute is
not set, a server-controlled default value will be used. A *batchSize* value of
*0* is disallowed.

@RESTDESCRIPTION

This will find all documents matching a given example.

Returns a cursor containing the result, see [HTTP Cursor](../AqlQueryCursor/README.md) for details.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
is returned if the query was executed successfully.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if the body does not contain a valid JSON representation of a
query. The response body contains an error document in this case.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
is returned if the collection specified by *collection* is unknown.  The
response body contains an error document in this case.

@startDocuBlock put_api_simple_remove_by_example

@brief removes all documents of a collection that match an example

@RESTHEADER{PUT /_api/simple/remove-by-example, Remove documents by example}

@HINTS
{% hint 'warning' %}
This route should no longer be used.
All endpoints for Simple Queries are deprecated from version 3.4.0 on.
They are superseded by AQL queries.
{% endhint %}

@RESTBODYPARAM{collection,string,required,string}
The name of the collection to remove from.

@RESTBODYPARAM{example,string,required,string}
An example document that all collection documents are compared against.

@RESTBODYPARAM{options,object,optional,put_api_simple_remove_by_example_opts}
a json object which can contains following attributes:

@RESTSTRUCT{waitForSync,put_api_simple_remove_by_example_opts,boolean,optional,}
if set to true, then all removal operations will
instantly be synchronized to disk. If this is not specified, then the
collection's default sync behavior will be applied.

@RESTSTRUCT{limit,put_api_simple_remove_by_example_opts,string,required,string}
an optional value that determines how many documents to
delete at most. If *limit* is specified but is less than the number
of documents in the collection, it is undefined which of the documents
will be deleted.

@RESTDESCRIPTION

This will find all documents in the collection that match the specified
example object.

Note: the *limit* attribute is not supported on sharded collections.
Using it will result in an error.

Returns the number of documents that were deleted.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
is returned if the query was executed successfully.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if the body does not contain a valid JSON representation of a
query. The response body contains an error document in this case.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
is returned if the collection specified by *collection* is unknown.  The
response body contains an error document in this case.

@startDocuBlock put_api_simple_fulltext

@brief returns documents of a collection as a result of a fulltext query

@RESTHEADER{PUT /_api/simple/fulltext, Fulltext index query}

@HINTS
{% hint 'warning' %}
This route should no longer be used.
All endpoints for Simple Queries are deprecated from version 3.4.0 on.
They are superseded by AQL queries.
{% endhint %}

@RESTBODYPARAM{collection,string,required,string}
The name of the collection to query.

@RESTBODYPARAM{attribute,string,required,string}
The attribute that contains the texts.

@RESTBODYPARAM{query,string,required,string}
The fulltext query. Please refer to [Fulltext queries](../../Manual/Appendix/Deprecated/SimpleQueries/FulltextQueries.html)
  for details.

@RESTBODYPARAM{skip,string,required,string}
The number of documents to skip in the query (optional).

@RESTBODYPARAM{limit,string,required,string}
The maximal amount of documents to return. The *skip*
is applied before the *limit* restriction. (optional)

@RESTBODYPARAM{index,string,required,string}
The identifier of the fulltext-index to use.

@RESTDESCRIPTION

This will find all documents from the collection that match the fulltext
query specified in *query*.

In order to use the *fulltext* operator, a fulltext index must be defined
for the collection and the specified attribute.

Returns a cursor containing the result, see [HTTP Cursor](../AqlQueryCursor/README.md) for details.

Note: the *fulltext* simple query is **deprecated** as of ArangoDB 2.6. 
This API may be removed in future versions of ArangoDB. The preferred
way for retrieving documents from a collection using the near operator is
to issue an AQL query using the *FULLTEXT* [AQL function](../../AQL/Functions/Fulltext.html) 
as follows:

    FOR doc IN FULLTEXT(@@collection, @attributeName, @queryString, @limit) 
      RETURN doc

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
is returned if the query was executed successfully.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if the body does not contain a valid JSON representation of a
query. The response body contains an error document in this case.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
is returned if the collection specified by *collection* is unknown.  The
response body contains an error document in this case.

@RESTBODYPARAM{options,object,optional,put_api_simple_replace_by_example_options}
a json object which can contain following attributes

@RESTSTRUCT{waitForSync,put_api_simple_replace_by_example_options,boolean,optional,}
if set to true, then all removal operations will
 instantly be synchronized to disk. If this is not specified, then the
 collection's default sync behavior will be applied.

@RESTSTRUCT{limit,put_api_simple_replace_by_example_options,string,optional,string}
an optional value that determines how many documents to
replace at most. If *limit* is specified but is less than the number
of documents in the collection, it is undefined which of the documents
will be replaced.


@RESTDESCRIPTION

This will find all documents in the collection that match the specified
example object, and replace the entire document body with the new value
specified. Note that document meta-attributes such as *_id*, *_key*,
*_from*, *_to* etc. cannot be replaced.

Note: the *limit* attribute is not supported on sharded collections.
Using it will result in an error.

Returns the number of documents that were replaced.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
is returned if the query was executed successfully.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if the body does not contain a valid JSON representation of a
query. The response body contains an error document in this case.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
is returned if the collection specified by *collection* is unknown.  The
response body contains an error document in this case.

@brief parse an AQL query and return information about it

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/query, Parse an AQL query, parseQuery}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
This endpoint is for query validation only. To actually query the database,
see `/api/cursor`.

@RESTBODYPARAM{query,string,required,string}
To validate a query string without executing it, the query string can be
passed to the server via an HTTP POST request.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
If the query is valid, the server will respond with *HTTP 200* and
return the names of the bind parameters it found in the query (if any) in
the *bindVars* attribute of the response. It will also return an array
of the collections used in the query in the *collections* attribute.
If a query can be parsed successfully, the *ast* attribute of the returned
JSON will contain the abstract syntax tree representation of the query.
The format of the *ast* is subject to change in future versions of
ArangoDB, but it can be used to inspect how ArangoDB interprets a given
query. Note that the abstract syntax tree will be returned without any
optimizations applied to it.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
The server will respond with *HTTP 400* in case of a malformed request,
or if the query contains a parse error. The body of the response will
contain the error details embedded in a JSON object.

The default is *false*, meaning only the optimal plan will be returned.

@RESTSTRUCT{maxNumberOfPlans,explain_options,integer,optional,int64}
an optional maximum number of plans that the optimizer is 
allowed to generate. Setting this attribute to a low value allows to put a
cap on the amount of work the optimizer does.

@RESTSTRUCT{optimizer.rules,explain_options,array,optional,string}
an array of to-be-included or to-be-excluded optimizer rules
can be put into this attribute, telling the optimizer to include or exclude
specific rules. To disable a rule, prefix its name with a `-`, to enable a rule, prefix it
with a `+`. There is also a pseudo-rule `all`, which will match all optimizer rules.

@RESTDESCRIPTION

To explain how an AQL query would be executed on the server, the query string
can be sent to the server via an HTTP POST request. The server will then validate
the query and create an execution plan for it. The execution plan will be
returned, but the query will not be executed.

The execution plan that is returned by the server can be used to estimate the
probable performance of the query. Though the actual performance will depend
on many different factors, the execution plan normally can provide some rough
estimates on the amount of work the server needs to do in order to actually run 
the query.

By default, the explain operation will return the optimal plan as chosen by
the query optimizer The optimal plan is the plan with the lowest total estimated
cost. The plan will be returned in the attribute *plan* of the response object.
If the option *allPlans* is specified in the request, the result will contain 
all plans created by the optimizer. The plans will then be returned in the 
attribute *plans*.

The result will also contain an attribute *warnings*, which is an array of 
warnings that occurred during optimization or execution plan creation. Additionally,
a *stats* attribute is contained in the result with some optimizer statistics.
If *allPlans* is set to *false*, the result will contain an attribute *cacheable* 
that states whether the query results can be cached on the server if the query
result cache were used. The *cacheable* attribute is not present when *allPlans*
is set to *true*.

Each plan in the result is a JSON object with the following attributes:
- *nodes*: the array of execution nodes of the plan. The array of available node types
  can be found [here](../../AQL/ExecutionAndPerformance/Optimizer.html)

- *estimatedCost*: the total estimated cost for the plan. If there are multiple
  plans, the optimizer will choose the plan with the lowest total cost.

- *collections*: an array of collections used in the query

- *rules*: an array of rules the optimizer applied. An overview of the
  available rules can be found [here](../../AQL/ExecutionAndPerformance/Optimizer.html)

- *variables*: array of variables used in the query (note: this may contain
  internal variables created by the optimizer)

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
If the query is valid, the server will respond with *HTTP 200* and
return the optimal execution plan in the *plan* attribute of the response.
If option *allPlans* was set in the request, an array of plans will be returned
in the *allPlans* attribute instead.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
The server will respond with *HTTP 400* in case of a malformed request,
or if the query contains a parse error. The body of the response will
contain the error details embedded in a JSON object.
Omitting bind variables if the query references any will also result
in an *HTTP 400* error.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
The server will respond with *HTTP 404* in case a non-existing collection is
accessed in the query.

The data returned in the **plan** attribute of the result contains one element per AQL top-level statement
(i.e. `FOR`, `RETURN`, `FILTER` etc.). If the query optimizer removed some unnecessary statements,
the result might also contain less elements than there were top-level statements in the AQL query.

The following example shows a query with a non-sensible filter condition that
the optimizer has removed so that there are less top-level statements.

@RESTHEADER{GET /_api/query/slow, Returns the list of slow AQL queries, readQuery:Slow}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Returns an array containing the last AQL queries that are finished and
have exceeded the slow query threshold in the selected database.
The maximum amount of queries in the list can be controlled by setting
the query tracking property `maxSlowQueries`. The threshold for treating
a query as *slow* can be adjusted by setting the query tracking property
`slowQueryThreshold`.

Each query is a JSON object with the following attributes:

- *id*: the query's id

- *query*: the query string (potentially truncated)

- *bindVars*: the bind parameter values used by the query

- *started*: the date and time when the query was started

- *runTime*: the query's total run time

@startDocuBlock GetApiQueryProperties

@brief returns the configuration for the AQL query tracking

@RESTHEADER{GET /_api/query/properties, Returns the properties for the AQL query tracking, readQueryProperties}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Returns the current query tracking configuration. The configuration is a
JSON object with the following properties:

- *enabled*: if set to *true*, then queries will be tracked. If set to
  *false*, neither queries nor slow queries will be tracked.

- *trackSlowQueries*: if set to *true*, then slow queries will be tracked
  in the list of slow queries if their runtime exceeds the value set in 
  *slowQueryThreshold*. In order for slow queries to be tracked, the *enabled*
  property must also be set to *true*.

- *trackBindVars*: if set to *true*, then bind variables used in queries will 
  be tracked.

- *maxSlowQueries*: the maximum number of slow queries to keep in the list
  of slow queries. If the list of slow queries is full, the oldest entry in
  it will be discarded when additional slow queries occur.

- *slowQueryThreshold*: the threshold value for treating a query as slow. A
  query with a runtime greater or equal to this threshold value will be
  put into the list of slow queries when slow query tracking is enabled.
  The value for *slowQueryThreshold* is specified in seconds.

- *maxQueryStringLength*: the maximum query string length to keep in the
  list of queries. Query strings can have arbitrary lengths, and this property
  can be used to save memory in case very long query strings are used. The
  value is specified in bytes.

@brief enable development mode

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/foxx/development, Enable development mode}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Puts the service into development mode.

While the service is running in development mode the service will be reloaded
from the filesystem and its setup script (if any) will be re-executed every
time the service handles a request.

When running ArangoDB in a cluster with multiple coordinators note that changes
to the filesystem on one coordinator will not be reflected across the other
coordinators. This means you should treat your coordinators as inconsistent
as long as any service is running in development mode.

@startDocuBlock api_foxx_service_replace

@brief replace a service

@RESTHEADER{PUT /_api/foxx/service, Replace service}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Removes the service at the given mount path from the database and file system.
Then installs the given new service at the same mount path.

This is a slightly safer equivalent to performing an uninstall of the old service
followed by installing the new service. The new service's main and script files
(if any) will be checked for basic syntax errors before the old service is removed.

The request body can be any of the following formats:

- `application/zip`: a raw zip bundle containing a service
- `application/javascript`: a standalone JavaScript file
- `application/json`: a service definition as JSON
- `multipart/form-data`: a service definition as a multipart form

A service definition is an object or form with the following properties or fields:

- *configuration*: a JSON object describing configuration values
- *dependencies*: a JSON object describing dependency settings
- *source*: a fully qualified URL or an absolute path on the server's file system

When using multipart data, the *source* field can also alternatively be a file field
containing either a zip bundle or a standalone JavaScript file.

When using a standalone JavaScript file the given file will be executed
to define our service's HTTP endpoints. It is the same which would be defined
in the field `main` of the service manifest.

If *source* is a URL, the URL must be reachable from the server.
If *source* is a file system path, the path will be resolved on the server.
In either case the path or URL is expected to resolve to a zip bundle,
JavaScript file or (in case of a file system path) directory.

Note that when using file system paths in a cluster with multiple coordinators
the file system path must resolve to equivalent files on every coordinator.

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{mount,string,required}
Mount path of the installed service.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{teardown,boolean,optional}
Set to `false` to not run the old service's teardown script.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{setup,boolean,optional}
Set to `false` to not run the new service's setup script.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{legacy,boolean,optional}
Set to `true` to install the new service in 2.8 legacy compatibility mode.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{force,boolean,optional}
Set to `true` to force service install even if no service is installed under given mount.

@brief run service tests

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/foxx/tests, Run service tests}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Runs the tests for the service at the given mount path and returns the results.

Supported test reporters are:

- *default*: a simple list of test cases
- *suite*: an object of test cases nested in suites
- *stream*: a raw stream of test results
- *xunit*: an XUnit/JUnit compatible structure
- *tap*: a raw TAP compatible stream

The *Accept* request header can be used to further control the response format:

When using the *stream* reporter `application/x-ldjson` will result
in the response body being formatted as a newline-delimited JSON stream.

When using the *tap* reporter `text/plain` or `text/*` will result
in the response body being formatted as a plain text TAP report.

When using the *xunit* reporter `application/xml` or `text/xml` will result
in the response body being formatted as XML instead of JSONML.

Otherwise the response body will be formatted as non-prettyprinted JSON.

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{mount,string,required}
Mount path of the installed service.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{reporter,string,optional}
Test reporter to use.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{idiomatic,boolean,optional}
Use the matching format for the reporter, regardless of the *Accept* header.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{filter,string,optional}
Only run tests where the full name (including full test suites and test case)
matches this string.

@startDocuBlock api_foxx_service_install

@brief install new service

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/foxx, Install new service}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Installs the given new service at the given mount path.

The request body can be any of the following formats:

- `application/zip`: a raw zip bundle containing a service
- `application/javascript`: a standalone JavaScript file
- `application/json`: a service definition as JSON
- `multipart/form-data`: a service definition as a multipart form

A service definition is an object or form with the following properties or fields:

- *configuration*: a JSON object describing configuration values
- *dependencies*: a JSON object describing dependency settings
- *source*: a fully qualified URL or an absolute path on the server's file system

When using multipart data, the *source* field can also alternatively be a file field
containing either a zip bundle or a standalone JavaScript file.

When using a standalone JavaScript file the given file will be executed
to define our service's HTTP endpoints. It is the same which would be defined
in the field `main` of the service manifest.

If *source* is a URL, the URL must be reachable from the server.
If *source* is a file system path, the path will be resolved on the server.
In either case the path or URL is expected to resolve to a zip bundle,
JavaScript file or (in case of a file system path) directory.

Note that when using file system paths in a cluster with multiple coordinators
the file system path must resolve to equivalent files on every coordinator.

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{mount,string,required}
Mount path the service should be installed at.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{development,boolean,optional}
Set to `true` to enable development mode.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{setup,boolean,optional}
Set to `false` to not run the service's setup script.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{legacy,boolean,optional}
Set to `true` to install the service in 2.8 legacy compatibility mode.

@brief upgrade a service

@RESTHEADER{PATCH /_api/foxx/service, Upgrade service}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Installs the given new service on top of the service currently installed at the given mount path.
This is only recommended for switching between different versions of the same service.

Unlike replacing a service, upgrading a service retains the old service's configuration
and dependencies (if any) and should therefore only be used to migrate an existing service
to a newer or equivalent service.

The request body can be any of the following formats:

- `application/zip`: a raw zip bundle containing a service
- `application/javascript`: a standalone JavaScript file
- `application/json`: a service definition as JSON
- `multipart/form-data`: a service definition as a multipart form

A service definition is an object or form with the following properties or fields:

- *configuration*: a JSON object describing configuration values
- *dependencies*: a JSON object describing dependency settings
- *source*: a fully qualified URL or an absolute path on the server's file system

When using multipart data, the *source* field can also alternatively be a file field
containing either a zip bundle or a standalone JavaScript file.

When using a standalone JavaScript file the given file will be executed
to define our service's HTTP endpoints. It is the same which would be defined
in the field `main` of the service manifest.

If *source* is a URL, the URL must be reachable from the server.
If *source* is a file system path, the path will be resolved on the server.
In either case the path or URL is expected to resolve to a zip bundle,
JavaScript file or (in case of a file system path) directory.

Note that when using file system paths in a cluster with multiple coordinators
the file system path must resolve to equivalent files on every coordinator.

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{mount,string,required}
Mount path of the installed service.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{teardown,boolean,optional}
Set to `true` to run the old service's teardown script.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{setup,boolean,optional}
Set to `false` to not run the new service's setup script.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{legacy,boolean,optional}
Set to `true` to install the new service in 2.8 legacy compatibility mode.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{force,boolean,optional}
Set to `true` to force service install even if no service is installed under given mount.

Has to contain a valid database name.

@RESTBODYPARAM{users,array,optional,get_api_database_new_USERS}
Has to be an array of user objects to initially create for the new database.
User information will not be changed for users that already exist.
If *users* is not specified or does not contain any users, a default user
*root* will be created with an empty string password. This ensures that the
new database will be accessible after it is created.
Each user object can contain the following attributes:

@RESTSTRUCT{username,get_api_database_new_USERS,string,required,string}
Login name of the user to be created

@RESTSTRUCT{passwd,get_api_database_new_USERS,string,required,string}

endpoint in this number of attempts, it will stop itself.

@RESTBODYPARAM{connectTimeout,integer,required,int64}
the timeout (in seconds) when attempting to connect to the
endpoint. This value is used for each connection attempt.

@RESTBODYPARAM{requestTimeout,integer,required,int64}
the timeout (in seconds) for individual requests to the endpoint.

@RESTBODYPARAM{chunkSize,integer,required,int64}
the requested maximum size for log transfer packets that
is used when the endpoint is contacted.

@RESTBODYPARAM{autoStart,boolean,required,}
whether or not to auto-start the replication applier on
(next and following) server starts

@RESTBODYPARAM{adaptivePolling,boolean,required,}
if set to *true*, the replication applier will fall
to sleep for an increasingly long period in case the logger server at the
endpoint does not have any more replication events to apply. Using
adaptive polling is thus useful to reduce the amount of work for both the
applier and the logger server for cases when there are only infrequent
changes. The downside is that when using adaptive polling, it might take
longer for the replication applier to detect that there are new replication
events on the logger server.

Setting *adaptivePolling* to false will make the replication applier
contact the logger server in a constant interval, regardless of whether
the logger server provides updates frequently or seldom.

@RESTBODYPARAM{includeSystem,boolean,required,}
whether or not system collection operations will be applied

@RESTBODYPARAM{autoResync,boolean,optional,}
whether or not the slave should perform a full automatic resynchronization
with the master in case the master cannot serve log data requested by the
slave,
or when the replication is started and no tick value can be found.

@RESTBODYPARAM{autoResyncRetries,integer,optional,int64}
number of resynchronization retries that will be performed in a row when
automatic resynchronization is enabled and kicks in. Setting this to *0*
will
effectively disable *autoResync*. Setting it to some other value will limit
the number of retries that are performed. This helps preventing endless
retries
in case resynchronizations always fail.

@RESTBODYPARAM{initialSyncMaxWaitTime,integer,optional,int64}
the maximum wait time (in seconds) that the initial synchronization will
wait for a response from the master when fetching initial collection data.
This wait time can be used to control after what time the initial
synchronization
will give up waiting for a response and fail. This value is relevant even
for continuous replication when *autoResync* is set to *true* because this
may re-start the initial synchronization when the master cannot provide
log data the slave requires.
This value will be ignored if set to *0*.

@RESTBODYPARAM{connectionRetryWaitTime,integer,optional,int64}
the time (in seconds) that the applier will intentionally idle before
it retries connecting to the master in case of connection problems.
This value will be ignored if set to *0*.

@RESTBODYPARAM{idleMinWaitTime,integer,optional,int64}
the minimum wait time (in seconds) that the applier will intentionally idle
before fetching more log data from the master in case the master has
already sent all its log data. This wait time can be used to control the
frequency with which the replication applier sends HTTP log fetch requests
to the master in case there is no write activity on the master.
This value will be ignored if set to *0*.

@RESTBODYPARAM{idleMaxWaitTime,integer,optional,int64}
the maximum wait time (in seconds) that the applier will intentionally idle 
before fetching more log data from the master in case the master has 
already sent all its log data and there have been previous log fetch attempts
that resulted in no more log data. This wait time can be used to control the
maximum frequency with which the replication applier sends HTTP log fetch
requests to the master in case there is no write activity on the master for
longer periods. This configuration value will only be used if the option
*adaptivePolling* is set to *true*.
This value will be ignored if set to *0*.

@RESTBODYPARAM{requireFromPresent,boolean,required,}
if set to *true*, then the replication applier will check
at start whether the start tick from which it starts or resumes replication is
still present on the master. If not, then there would be data loss. If 
*requireFromPresent* is *true*, the replication applier will abort with an
appropriate error message. If set to *false*, then the replication applier will
still start, and ignore the data loss.

@RESTBODYPARAM{verbose,boolean,required,}
if set to *true*, then a log line will be emitted for all operations 
performed by the replication applier. This should be used for debugging replication
problems only.

@RESTBODYPARAM{restrictType,string,required,string}
the configuration for *restrictCollections*; Has to be either *include* or *exclude*

@RESTBODYPARAM{restrictCollections,array,optional,string}
the array of collections to include or exclude,
based on the setting of *restrictType*

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Sets the configuration of the replication applier. The configuration can
only be changed while the applier is not running. The updated configuration
will be saved immediately but only become active with the next start of the
applier.

In case of success, the body of the response is a JSON object with the updated
configuration.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
is returned if the request was executed successfully.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if the configuration is incomplete or malformed, or if the
replication applier is currently running.

@RESTRETURNCODE{405}
is returned when an invalid HTTP method is used.

@RESTRETURNCODE{500}
is returned if an error occurred while assembling the response.

@brief handle a dump batch command

@RESTHEADER{DELETE /_api/replication/batch/{id}, Deletes an existing dump batch,handleCommandBatch:DELETE}

**Note**: These calls are uninteresting to users.

@RESTURLPARAMETERS

@RESTURLPARAM{id,string,required}
The id of the batch.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Deletes the existing dump batch, allowing compaction and cleanup to resume.

**Note**: on a coordinator, this request must have the query parameter
*DBserver* which must be an ID of a DBserver.
The very same request is forwarded synchronously to that DBserver.
It is an error if this attribute is not bound in the coordinator case.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{204}
is returned if the batch was deleted successfully.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if the batch was not found.

@RESTRETURNCODE{405}

@brief Fetch log lines from the server

@RESTHEADER{GET /_api/replication/logger-follow, Returns log entries, handleCommandLoggerFollow}

@HINTS
{% hint 'warning' %}
This route should no longer be used.
It is considered as deprecated from version 3.4.0 on.
{% endhint %}

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{from,number,optional}
Exclusive lower bound tick value for results.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{to,number,optional}
Inclusive upper bound tick value for results.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{chunkSize,number,optional}
Approximate maximum size of the returned result.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{includeSystem,boolean,optional}
Include system collections in the result. The default value is *true*.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Returns data from the server's replication log. This method can be called
by replication clients after an initial synchronization of data. The method
will return all "recent" log entries from the logger server, and the clients
can replay and apply these entries locally so they get to the same data
state as the logger server.

Clients can call this method repeatedly to incrementally fetch all changes
from the logger server. In this case, they should provide the *from* value so
they will only get returned the log events since their last fetch.

When the *from* query parameter is not used, the logger server will return log
entries starting at the beginning of its replication log. When the *from*
parameter is used, the logger server will only return log entries which have
higher tick values than the specified *from* value (note: the log entry with a
tick value equal to *from* will be excluded). Use the *from* value when
incrementally fetching log data.

The *to* query parameter can be used to optionally restrict the upper bound of
the result to a certain tick value. If used, the result will contain only log events
with tick values up to (including) *to*. In incremental fetching, there is no
need to use the *to* parameter. It only makes sense in special situations,
when only parts of the change log are required.

The *chunkSize* query parameter can be used to control the size of the result.
It must be specified in bytes. The *chunkSize* value will only be honored
approximately. Otherwise a too low *chunkSize* value could cause the server
to not be able to put just one log entry into the result and return it.
Therefore, the *chunkSize* value will only be consulted after a log entry has
been written into the result. If the result size is then bigger than
*chunkSize*, the server will respond with as many log entries as there are
in the response already. If the result size is still smaller than *chunkSize*,
the server will try to return more data if there's more data left to return.

If *chunkSize* is not specified, some server-side default value will be used.

The *Content-Type* of the result is *application/x-arango-dump*. This is an
easy-to-process format, with all log events going onto separate lines in the
response body. Each log event itself is a JSON object, with at least the
following attributes:

- *tick*: the log event tick value

- *type*: the log event type

Individual log events will also have additional attributes, depending on the
event type. A few common attributes which are used for multiple events types
are:

- *cid*: id of the collection the event was for

- *tid*: id of the transaction the event was contained in

- *key*: document key

- *rev*: document revision id

- *data*: the original document data

A more detailed description of the individual replication event types and their
data structures can be found in [Operation Types](../Replications/WALAccess.html#operation-types).

The response will also contain the following HTTP headers:

- *x-arango-replication-active*: whether or not the logger is active. Clients
  can use this flag as an indication for their polling frequency. If the
  logger is not active and there are no more replication events available, it
  might be sensible for a client to abort, or to go to sleep for a long time
  and try again later to check whether the logger has been activated.

- *x-arango-replication-lastincluded*: the tick value of the last included
  value in the result. In incremental log fetching, this value can be used
  as the *from* value for the following request. **Note** that if the result is
  empty, the value will be *0*. This value should not be used as *from* value
  by clients in the next request (otherwise the server would return the log
  events from the start of the log again).

- *x-arango-replication-lasttick*: the last tick value the logger server has
  logged (not necessarily included in the result). By comparing the the last
  tick and last included tick values, clients have an approximate indication of
  how many events there are still left to fetch.

- *x-arango-replication-checkmore*: whether or not there already exists more
  log data which the client could fetch immediately. If there is more log data
  available, the client could call *logger-follow* again with an adjusted *from*
  value to fetch remaining log entries until there are no more.

  If there isn't any more log data to fetch, the client might decide to go
  to sleep for a while before calling the logger again.

**Note**: this method is not supported on a coordinator in a cluster.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
is returned if the request was executed successfully, and there are log
events available for the requested range. The response body will not be empty
in this case.

@RESTRETURNCODE{204}
is returned if the request was executed successfully, but there are no log
events available for the requested range. The response body will be empty
in this case.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if either the *from* or *to* values are invalid.

@RESTRETURNCODE{405}
is returned when an invalid HTTP method is used.

@RESTRETURNCODE{500}
is returned if an error occurred while assembling the response.

@RESTRETURNCODE{501}
is returned when this operation is called on a coordinator in a cluster.

@startDocuBlock put_api_replication_synchronize

@brief start a replication

@RESTHEADER{PUT /_api/replication/sync, Synchronize data from a remote endpoint, handleCommandSync}

@RESTBODYPARAM{endpoint,string,required,string}
the master endpoint to connect to (e.g. "tcp://192.168.173.13:8529").

@RESTBODYPARAM{database,string,optional,string}
the database name on the master (if not specified, defaults to the
name of the local current database).

@RESTBODYPARAM{username,string,optional,string}
an optional ArangoDB username to use when connecting to the endpoint.

@RESTBODYPARAM{password,string,required,string}
the password to use when connecting to the endpoint.

@RESTBODYPARAM{includeSystem,boolean,optional,}
whether or not system collection operations will be applied

@RESTBODYPARAM{incremental,boolean,optional,}
if set to *true*, then an incremental synchronization method will be used
for synchronizing data in collections. This method is useful when
collections already exist locally, and only the remaining differences need
to be transferred from the remote endpoint. In this case, the incremental
synchronization can be faster than a full synchronization.
The default value is *false*, meaning that the complete data from the remote
collection will be transferred.

@RESTBODYPARAM{restrictType,string,optional,string}
an optional string value for collection filtering. When
specified, the allowed values are *include* or *exclude*.

@RESTBODYPARAM{restrictCollections,array,optional,string}
an optional array of collections for use with
*restrictType*. If *restrictType* is *include*, only the specified collections
will be sychronised. If *restrictType* is *exclude*, all but the specified
collections will be synchronized.

@RESTBODYPARAM{initialSyncMaxWaitTime,integer,optional,int64}
the maximum wait time (in seconds) that the initial synchronization will
wait for a response from the master when fetching initial collection data.
This wait time can be used to control after what time the initial synchronization
will give up waiting for a response and fail.
This value will be ignored if set to *0*.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Starts a full data synchronization from a remote endpoint into the local
ArangoDB database.

The *sync* method can be used by replication clients to connect an ArangoDB database
to a remote endpoint, fetch the remote list of collections and indexes, and collection
data. It will thus create a local backup of the state of data at the remote ArangoDB
database. *sync* works on a per-database level.

*sync* will first fetch the list of collections and indexes from the remote endpoint.
It does so by calling the *inventory* API of the remote database. It will then purge
data in the local ArangoDB database, and after start will transfer collection data
from the remote database to the local ArangoDB database. It will extract data from the
remote database by calling the remote database's *dump* API until all data are fetched.

In case of success, the body of the response is a JSON object with the following
attributes:

- *collections*: an array of collections that were transferred from the endpoint

- *lastLogTick*: the last log tick on the endpoint at the time the transfer
  was started. Use this value as the *from* value when starting the continuous
  synchronization later.

WARNING: calling this method will sychronize data from the collections found
on the remote endpoint to the local ArangoDB database. All data in the local
collections will be purged and replaced with data from the endpoint.

Use with caution!

**Note**: this method is not supported on a coordinator in a cluster.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
is returned if the request was executed successfully.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if the configuration is incomplete or malformed.

@RESTRETURNCODE{405}
is returned when an invalid HTTP method is used.

@RESTRETURNCODE{500}
is returned if an error occurred during sychronization.

@RESTRETURNCODE{501}
is returned when this operation is called on a coordinator in a cluster.

@startDocuBlock get_api_wal_access_last_tick

@brief Return last available tick value

@RESTHEADER{GET /_api/wal/lastTick, Return last available tick value, handleCommandLastTick}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Returns the last available tick value that can be served from the server's
replication log. This corresponds to the tick of the latest successfull operation.

The result is a JSON object containing the attributes *tick*, *time* and *server*. 
* *tick*: contains the last available tick, *time* 
* *time*: the server time as string in format "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"
* *server*: An object with fields *version* and *serverId*

**Note**: this method is not supported on a coordinator in a cluster.

@brief start the replication applier

@RESTHEADER{PUT /_api/replication/applier-start, Start replication applier,handleCommandApplierStart}

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{from,string,optional}
The remote *lastLogTick* value from which to start applying. If not specified,
the last saved tick from the previous applier run is used. If there is no
previous applier state saved, the applier will start at the beginning of the
logger server's log.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Starts the replication applier. This will return immediately if the
replication applier is already running.

If the replication applier is not already running, the applier configuration
will be checked, and if it is complete, the applier will be started in a
background thread. This means that even if the applier will encounter any
errors while running, they will not be reported in the response to this
method.

To detect replication applier errors after the applier was started, use the
*/_api/replication/applier-state* API instead.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
is returned if the request was executed successfully.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if the replication applier is not fully configured or the
configuration is invalid.

@RESTRETURNCODE{405}
is returned when an invalid HTTP method is used.

@RESTRETURNCODE{500}
is returned if an error occurred while assembling the response.

@brief fetch the current replication configuration

@RESTHEADER{GET /_api/replication/applier-config, Return configuration of replication applier, handleCommandApplierGetConfig}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Returns the configuration of the replication applier.

The body of the response is a JSON object with the configuration. The
following attributes may be present in the configuration:

- *endpoint*: the logger server to connect to (e.g. "tcp://192.168.173.13:8529").

- *database*: the name of the database to connect to (e.g. "_system").

- *username*: an optional ArangoDB username to use when connecting to the endpoint.

- *password*: the password to use when connecting to the endpoint.

- *maxConnectRetries*: the maximum number of connection attempts the applier
  will make in a row. If the applier cannot establish a connection to the
  endpoint in this number of attempts, it will stop itself.

- *connectTimeout*: the timeout (in seconds) when attempting to connect to the
  endpoint. This value is used for each connection attempt.

- *requestTimeout*: the timeout (in seconds) for individual requests to the endpoint.

- *chunkSize*: the requested maximum size for log transfer packets that
  is used when the endpoint is contacted.

- *autoStart*: whether or not to auto-start the replication applier on
  (next and following) server starts

- *adaptivePolling*: whether or not the replication applier will use
  adaptive polling.

- *includeSystem*: whether or not system collection operations will be applied

- *autoResync*: whether or not the slave should perform a full automatic
  resynchronization with the master in case the master cannot serve log data
  requested by the slave, or when the replication is started and no tick
  value
  can be found.

- *autoResyncRetries*: number of resynchronization retries that will be performed
  in a row when automatic resynchronization is enabled and kicks in. Setting this
  to *0* will effectively disable *autoResync*. Setting it to some other value
  will limit the number of retries that are performed. This helps preventing endless
  retries in case resynchronizations always fail.

- *initialSyncMaxWaitTime*: the maximum wait time (in seconds) that the initial
  synchronization will wait for a response from the master when fetching initial
  collection data.
  This wait time can be used to control after what time the initial synchronization
  will give up waiting for a response and fail. This value is relevant even
  for continuous replication when *autoResync* is set to *true* because this
  may re-start the initial synchronization when the master cannot provide
  log data the slave requires.
  This value will be ignored if set to *0*.

- *connectionRetryWaitTime*: the time (in seconds) that the applier will
  intentionally idle before it retries connecting to the master in case of
  connection problems.
  This value will be ignored if set to *0*.

- *idleMinWaitTime*: the minimum wait time (in seconds) that the applier will
  intentionally idle before fetching more log data from the master in case
  the master has already sent all its log data. This wait time can be used
  to control the frequency with which the replication applier sends HTTP log
  fetch requests to the master in case there is no write activity on the master.
  This value will be ignored if set to *0*.

- *idleMaxWaitTime*: the maximum wait time (in seconds) that the applier will
  intentionally idle before fetching more log data from the master in case the
  master has already sent all its log data and there have been previous log
  fetch attempts that resulted in no more log data. This wait time can be used
  to control the maximum frequency with which the replication applier sends HTTP
  log fetch requests to the master in case there is no write activity on the
  master for longer periods. This configuration value will only be used if the
  option *adaptivePolling* is set to *true*.
  This value will be ignored if set to *0*.

- *requireFromPresent*: if set to *true*, then the replication applier will check
  at start whether the start tick from which it starts or resumes replication is
  still present on the master. If not, then there would be data loss. If
  *requireFromPresent* is *true*, the replication applier will abort with an
  appropriate error message. If set to *false*, then the replication applier will
  still start, and ignore the data loss.

- *verbose*: if set to *true*, then a log line will be emitted for all operations
  performed by the replication applier. This should be used for debugging
  replication
  problems only.

- *restrictType*: the configuration for *restrictCollections*

- *restrictCollections*: the optional array of collections to include or exclude,
  based on the setting of *restrictType*

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
is returned if the request was executed successfully.

@RESTRETURNCODE{405}
is returned when an invalid HTTP method is used.

@RESTRETURNCODE{500}
is returned if an error occurred while assembling the response.

@brief returns the whole content of one collection

@RESTHEADER{GET /_api/replication/dump, Return data of a collection,handleCommandDump}

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{collection,string,required}
The name or id of the collection to dump.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{chunkSize,number,optional} Approximate maximum size of the returned result.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{batchId,number,required}
rocksdb only - The id of the snapshot to use

@RESTQUERYPARAM{from,number,optional}
mmfiles only - Lower bound tick value for results.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{to,number,optional}
mmfiles only - Upper bound tick value for results.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{includeSystem,boolean,optional}
mmfiles only - Include system collections in the result. The default value is *true*.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{ticks,boolean,optional}
mmfiles only - Whether or not to include tick values in the dump. The default value is *true*.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{flush,boolean,optional}
mmfiles only - Whether or not to flush the WAL before dumping. The default value is *true*.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Returns the data from the collection for the requested range.

When the *from* query parameter is not used, collection events are returned from
the beginning. When the *from* parameter is used, the result will only contain
collection entries which have higher tick values than the specified *from* value
(note: the log entry with a tick value equal to *from* will be excluded).

The *to* query parameter can be used to optionally restrict the upper bound of
the result to a certain tick value. If used, the result will only contain
collection entries with tick values up to (including) *to*.

The *chunkSize* query parameter can be used to control the size of the result.
It must be specified in bytes. The *chunkSize* value will only be honored
approximately. Otherwise a too low *chunkSize* value could cause the server
to not be able to put just one entry into the result and return it.
Therefore, the *chunkSize* value will only be consulted after an entry has
been written into the result. If the result size is then bigger than
*chunkSize*, the server will respond with as many entries as there are
in the response already. If the result size is still smaller than *chunkSize*,
the server will try to return more data if there's more data left to return.

If *chunkSize* is not specified, some server-side default value will be used.

The *Content-Type* of the result is *application/x-arango-dump*. This is an
easy-to-process format, with all entries going onto separate lines in the
response body.

Each line itself is a JSON object, with at least the following attributes:

- *tick*: the operation's tick attribute

- *key*: the key of the document/edge or the key used in the deletion operation

- *rev*: the revision id of the document/edge or the deletion operation

- *data*: the actual document/edge data for types 2300 and 2301. The full
  document/edge data will be returned even for updates.

- *type*: the type of entry. Possible values for *type* are:

  - 2300: document insertion/update

  - 2301: edge insertion/update

  - 2302: document/edge deletion

**Note**: there will be no distinction between inserts and updates when calling this method.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
is returned if the request was executed successfully and data was returned. The header
`x-arango-replication-lastincluded` is set to the tick of the last document returned.

@RESTRETURNCODE{204}
is returned if the request was executed successfully, but there was no content available.
The header `x-arango-replication-lastincluded` is `0` in this case.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if either the *from* or *to* values are invalid.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
is returned when the collection could not be found.

@RESTRETURNCODE{405}
is returned when an invalid HTTP method is used.

@RESTRETURNCODE{500}
is returned if an error occurred while assembling the response.

@startDocuBlock get_api_wal_access_tail

@brief Fetch recent operations

@RESTHEADER{GET /_api/wal/tail, Tail recent server operations, handleCommandTail}

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{from,number,optional}
Exclusive lower bound tick value for results. On successive calls
to this API you should set this to the value returned
with the *x-arango-replication-lastincluded* header (Unless that header
contains 0).

@RESTQUERYPARAM{to,number,optional}
Inclusive upper bound tick value for results.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{lastScanned,number,optional}
Should be set to the value of the *x-arango-replication-lastscanned* header
or alternatively 0 on first try. This allows the rocksdb engine to break up
large transactions over multiple responses. 

@RESTQUERYPARAM{global,boolean,optional}
Whether operations for all databases should be included. When set to *false*
only the operations for the current database are included. The value *true* is
only valid on the *_system* database. The default is *false*.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{chunkSize,number,optional}
Approximate maximum size of the returned result.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{syncerId,number,optional}
Id of the client used to tail results. The server will use this to 
keep operations until the client has fetched them. Must be a positive integer.
**Note** this or serverId is required to have a chance at fetching reading all
operations with the rocksdb storage engine.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{serverId,number,optional}
Id of the client machine. If *syncerId* is unset, the server will use
this to keep operations until the client has fetched them. Must be a positive
integer.
**Note** this or syncerId is required to have a chance at fetching reading all
operations with the rocksdb storage engine.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{clientInfo,string,optional}
Short description of the client, used for informative purposes only.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{barrierId,number,optional}
Id of barrier used to keep WAL entries around. **Note** this is only required for the 
MMFiles storage engine

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Returns data from the server's write-ahead log (also named replication log). This method can be called
by replication clients after an initial synchronization of data. The method
will return all "recent" logged operations from the server. Clients
can replay and apply these operations locally so they get to the same data
state as the server.

Clients can call this method repeatedly to incrementally fetch all changes
from the server. In this case, they should provide the *from* value so
they will only get returned the log events since their last fetch.

When the *from* query parameter is not used, the server will return log
entries starting at the beginning of its replication log. When the *from*
parameter is used, the server will only return log entries which have
higher tick values than the specified *from* value (note: the log entry with a
tick value equal to *from* will be excluded). Use the *from* value when
incrementally fetching log data.

The *to* query parameter can be used to optionally restrict the upper bound of
the result to a certain tick value. If used, the result will contain only log events
with tick values up to (including) *to*. In incremental fetching, there is no
need to use the *to* parameter. It only makes sense in special situations,
when only parts of the change log are required.

The *chunkSize* query parameter can be used to control the size of the result.
It must be specified in bytes. The *chunkSize* value will only be honored
approximately. Otherwise a too low *chunkSize* value could cause the server
to not be able to put just one log entry into the result and return it.
Therefore, the *chunkSize* value will only be consulted after a log entry has
been written into the result. If the result size is then bigger than
*chunkSize*, the server will respond with as many log entries as there are
in the response already. If the result size is still smaller than *chunkSize*,
the server will try to return more data if there's more data left to return.

If *chunkSize* is not specified, some server-side default value will be used.

The *Content-Type* of the result is *application/x-arango-dump*. This is an
easy-to-process format, with all log events going onto separate lines in the
response body. Each log event itself is a JSON object, with at least the
following attributes:

- *tick*: the log event tick value

- *type*: the log event type

Individual log events will also have additional attributes, depending on the
event type. A few common attributes which are used for multiple events types
are:

- *cuid*: globally unique id of the view or collection the event was for

- *db*: the database name the event was for

- *tid*: id of the transaction the event was contained in

- *data*: the original document data

A more detailed description of the individual replication event types and their
data structures can be found in [Operation Types](#operation-types).

The response will also contain the following HTTP headers:

- *x-arango-replication-active*: whether or not the logger is active. Clients
  can use this flag as an indication for their polling frequency. If the
  logger is not active and there are no more replication events available, it
  might be sensible for a client to abort, or to go to sleep for a long time
  and try again later to check whether the logger has been activated.

- *x-arango-replication-lastincluded*: the tick value of the last included
  value in the result. In incremental log fetching, this value can be used
  as the *from* value for the following request. **Note** that if the result is
  empty, the value will be *0*. This value should not be used as *from* value
  by clients in the next request (otherwise the server would return the log
  events from the start of the log again).

- *x-arango-replication-lastscanned*: the last tick the server scanned while
  computing the operation log. This might include operations the server did not
  returned to you due to various reasons (i.e. the value was filtered or skipped).
  You may use this value in the *lastScanned* header to allow the rocksdb engine
  to break up requests over multiple responses.

- *x-arango-replication-lasttick*: the last tick value the server has
  logged in its write ahead log (not necessarily included in the result). By comparing the the last
  tick and last included tick values, clients have an approximate indication of
  how many events there are still left to fetch.

- *x-arango-replication-frompresent*: is set to _true_ if server returned
  all tick values starting from the specified tick in the _from_ parameter.
  Should this be set to false the server did not have these operations anymore
  and the client might have missed operations.

- *x-arango-replication-checkmore*: whether or not there already exists more
  log data which the client could fetch immediately. If there is more log data
  available, the client could call *logger-follow* again with an adjusted *from*
  value to fetch remaining log entries until there are no more.

  If there isn't any more log data to fetch, the client might decide to go
  to sleep for a while before calling the logger again.

**Note**: this method is not supported on a coordinator in a cluster.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
is returned if the request was executed successfully, and there are log
events available for the requested range. The response body will not be empty
in this case.

@RESTRETURNCODE{204}
is returned if the request was executed successfully, but there are no log
events available for the requested range. The response body will be empty
in this case.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if either the *from* or *to* values are invalid.

@RESTRETURNCODE{405}
is returned when an invalid HTTP method is used.

@RESTRETURNCODE{500}
is returned if an error occurred while assembling the response.

@RESTRETURNCODE{501}
is returned when this operation is called on a coordinator in a cluster.

@startDocuBlock get_api_replication_applier_state

@brief output the current status of the replication

@RESTHEADER{GET /_api/replication/applier-state, State of the replication applier,handleCommandApplierGetState}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Returns the state of the replication applier, regardless of whether the
applier is currently running or not.

The response is a JSON object with the following attributes:

- *state*: a JSON object with the following sub-attributes:

  - *running*: whether or not the applier is active and running

  - *lastAppliedContinuousTick*: the last tick value from the continuous
    replication log the applier has applied.

  - *lastProcessedContinuousTick*: the last tick value from the continuous
    replication log the applier has processed.

    Regularly, the last applied and last processed tick values should be
    identical. For transactional operations, the replication applier will first
    process incoming log events before applying them, so the processed tick
    value might be higher than the applied tick value. This will be the case
    until the applier encounters the *transaction commit* log event for the
    transaction.

  - *lastAvailableContinuousTick*: the last tick value the remote server can
    provide, for all databases.

  - *ticksBehind*: this attribute will be present only if the applier is currently
    running. It will provide the number of log ticks between what the applier
    has applied/seen and the last log tick value provided by the remote server.
    If this value is zero, then both servers are in sync. If this is non-zero,
    then the remote server has additional data that the applier has not yet
    fetched and processed, or the remote server may have more data that is not
    applicable to the applier.

    Client applications can use it to determine approximately how far the applier
    is behind the remote server, and can periodically check if the value is 
    increasing (applier is falling behind) or decreasing (applier is catching up).
    
    Please note that as the remote server will only keep one last log tick value 
    for all of its databases, but replication may be restricted to just certain 
    databases on the applier, this value is more meaningful when the global applier 
    is used.
    Additionally, the last log tick provided by the remote server may increase
    due to writes into system collections that are not replicated due to replication
    configuration. So the reported value may exaggerate the reality a bit for
    some scenarios. 

  - *time*: the time on the applier server.

  - *totalRequests*: the total number of requests the applier has made to the
    endpoint.

  - *totalFailedConnects*: the total number of failed connection attempts the
    applier has made.

  - *totalEvents*: the total number of log events the applier has processed.

  - *totalOperationsExcluded*: the total number of log events excluded because
    of *restrictCollections*.

  - *progress*: a JSON object with details about the replication applier progress.
    It contains the following sub-attributes if there is progress to report:

    - *message*: a textual description of the progress

    - *time*: the date and time the progress was logged

    - *failedConnects*: the current number of failed connection attempts

  - *lastError*: a JSON object with details about the last error that happened on
    the applier. It contains the following sub-attributes if there was an error:

    - *errorNum*: a numerical error code

    - *errorMessage*: a textual error description

    - *time*: the date and time the error occurred

    In case no error has occurred, *lastError* will be empty.

- *server*: a JSON object with the following sub-attributes:

  - *version*: the applier server's version

  - *serverId*: the applier server's id

<!-- filename: /work/ArangoDB/Documentation/DocuBlocks/Rest/Replication/put_api_replication_inventory.md -->
@startDocuBlock put_api_replication_inventory

@brief Returns an overview of collections and their indexes

@RESTHEADER{GET /_api/replication/inventory, Return inventory of collections and indexes, handleCommandInventory}

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{includeSystem,boolean,optional}
Include system collections in the result. The default value is *true*.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{global,boolean,optional}
Include alll databases in the response. Only works on `_system` The default value is *false*.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{batchId,number,required}
The RocksDB engine requires a valid batchId for this API call

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Returns the array of collections and indexes available on the server. This
array can be used by replication clients to initiate an initial sync with the
server.

The response will contain a JSON object with the *collection* and *state* and
*tick* attributes.

*collections* is an array of collections with the following sub-attributes:

- *parameters*: the collection properties

- *indexes*: an array of the indexes of a the collection. Primary indexes and edge indexes
   are not included in this array.

The *state* attribute contains the current state of the replication logger. It
contains the following sub-attributes:

- *running*: whether or not the replication logger is currently active. Note:
  since ArangoDB 2.2, the value will always be *true*

- *lastLogTick*: the value of the last tick the replication logger has written

- *time*: the current time on the server

Replication clients should note the *lastLogTick* value returned. They can then
fetch collections' data using the dump method up to the value of lastLogTick, and
query the continuous replication log for log events after this tick value.

To create a full copy of the collections on the server, a replication client
can execute these steps:

- call the */inventory* API method. This returns the *lastLogTick* value and the
  array of collections and indexes from the server.

- for each collection returned by */inventory*, create the collection locally and
  call */dump* to stream the collection data to the client, up to the value of
  *lastLogTick*.
  After that, the client can create the indexes on the collections as they were
  reported by */inventory*.

If the clients wants to continuously stream replication log events from the logger
server, the following additional steps need to be carried out:

- the client should call */logger-follow* initially to fetch the first batch of
  replication events that were logged after the client's call to */inventory*.

  The call to */logger-follow* should use a *from* parameter with the value of the
  *lastLogTick* as reported by */inventory*. The call to */logger-follow* will return the
  *x-arango-replication-lastincluded* which will contain the last tick value included
  in the response.

- the client can then continuously call */logger-follow* to incrementally fetch new
  replication events that occurred after the last transfer.

  Calls should use a *from* parameter with the value of the *x-arango-replication-lastincluded*
  header of the previous response. If there are no more replication events, the
  response will be empty and clients can go to sleep for a while and try again
  later.

**Note**: on a coordinator, this request must have the query parameter
*DBserver* which must be an ID of a DBserver.
The very same request is forwarded synchronously to that DBserver.
It is an error if this attribute is not bound in the coordinator case.

**Note:**: Using the `global` parameter the top-level object contains a key `databases`
under which each key represents a datbase name, and the value conforms to the above describtion.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}
is returned if the request was executed successfully.

@RESTRETURNCODE{405}
is returned when an invalid HTTP method is used.

@RESTRETURNCODE{500}
is returned if an error occurred while assembling the response.

@brief Changes role to slave

@RESTHEADER{PUT /_api/replication/make-slave, Turn the server into a slave of another, handleCommandMakeSlave}

@RESTBODYPARAM{endpoint,string,required,string}
the master endpoint to connect to (e.g. "tcp://192.168.173.13:8529").

@RESTBODYPARAM{database,string,required,string}
the database name on the master (if not specified, defaults to the
name of the local current database).

@RESTBODYPARAM{username,string,optional,string}
an optional ArangoDB username to use when connecting to the master.

@RESTBODYPARAM{password,string,required,string}
the password to use when connecting to the master.

@RESTBODYPARAM{includeSystem,boolean,required,}
whether or not system collection operations will be applied

@RESTBODYPARAM{restrictType,string,optional,string}
an optional string value for collection filtering. When
specified, the allowed values are *include* or *exclude*.

@RESTBODYPARAM{restrictCollections,array,optional,string}
an optional array of collections for use with *restrictType*.
If *restrictType* is *include*, only the specified collections
will be sychronised. If *restrictType* is *exclude*, all but the specified
collections will be synchronized.

@RESTBODYPARAM{maxConnectRetries,integer,optional,int64}
the maximum number of connection attempts the applier
will make in a row. If the applier cannot establish a connection to the
endpoint in this number of attempts, it will stop itself.

@RESTBODYPARAM{connectTimeout,integer,optional,int64}
the timeout (in seconds) when attempting to connect to the
endpoint. This value is used for each connection attempt.

@RESTBODYPARAM{requestTimeout,integer,optional,int64}
the timeout (in seconds) for individual requests to the endpoint.

@RESTBODYPARAM{chunkSize,integer,optional,int64}
the requested maximum size for log transfer packets that
is used when the endpoint is contacted.

@RESTBODYPARAM{adaptivePolling,boolean,optional,}
whether or not the replication applier will use adaptive polling.

@RESTBODYPARAM{autoResync,boolean,optional,}
whether or not the slave should perform an automatic resynchronization with
the master in case the master cannot serve log data requested by the slave,
or when the replication is started and no tick value can be found.

@RESTBODYPARAM{autoResyncRetries,integer,optional,int64}
number of resynchronization retries that will be performed in a row when
automatic resynchronization is enabled and kicks in. Setting this to *0* will
effectively disable *autoResync*. Setting it to some other value will limit
the number of retries that are performed. This helps preventing endless retries
in case resynchronizations always fail.

@RESTBODYPARAM{initialSyncMaxWaitTime,integer,optional,int64}
the maximum wait time (in seconds) that the initial synchronization will
wait for a response from the master when fetching initial collection data.
This wait time can be used to control after what time the initial synchronization
will give up waiting for a response and fail. This value is relevant even
for continuous replication when *autoResync* is set to *true* because this
may re-start the initial synchronization when the master cannot provide
log data the slave requires.
This value will be ignored if set to *0*.

@RESTBODYPARAM{connectionRetryWaitTime,integer,optional,int64}
the time (in seconds) that the applier will intentionally idle before
it retries connecting to the master in case of connection problems.
This value will be ignored if set to *0*.

@RESTBODYPARAM{idleMinWaitTime,integer,optional,int64}
the minimum wait time (in seconds) that the applier will intentionally idle
before fetching more log data from the master in case the master has
already sent all its log data. This wait time can be used to control the
frequency with which the replication applier sends HTTP log fetch requests
to the master in case there is no write activity on the master.
This value will be ignored if set to *0*.

@RESTBODYPARAM{idleMaxWaitTime,integer,optional,int64}
the maximum wait time (in seconds) that the applier will intentionally idle
before fetching more log data from the master in case the master has
already sent all its log data and there have been previous log fetch attempts
that resulted in no more log data. This wait time can be used to control the
maximum frequency with which the replication applier sends HTTP log fetch
requests to the master in case there is no write activity on the master for
longer periods. This configuration value will only be used if the option
*adaptivePolling* is set to *true*.
This value will be ignored if set to *0*.

@RESTBODYPARAM{requireFromPresent,boolean,optional,}
if set to *true*, then the replication applier will check
at start of its continuous replication if the start tick from the dump phase
is still present on the master. If not, then there would be data loss. If
*requireFromPresent* is *true*, the replication applier will abort with an
appropriate error message. If set to *false*, then the replication applier will
still start, and ignore the data loss.

@RESTBODYPARAM{verbose,boolean,optional,}
if set to *true*, then a log line will be emitted for all operations
performed by the replication applier. This should be used for debugging
replication
problems only.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Starts a full data synchronization from a remote endpoint into the local ArangoDB
database and afterwards starts the continuous replication.
The operation works on a per-database level.

All local database data will be removed prior to the synchronization.

In case of success, the body of the response is a JSON object with the following
attributes:

- *state*: a JSON object with the following sub-attributes:

  - *running*: whether or not the applier is active and running

  - *lastAppliedContinuousTick*: the last tick value from the continuous
    replication log the applier has applied.

  - *lastProcessedContinuousTick*: the last tick value from the continuous
    replication log the applier has processed.

    Regularly, the last applied and last processed tick values should be
    identical. For transactional operations, the replication applier will first
    process incoming log events before applying them, so the processed tick
    value might be higher than the applied tick value. This will be the case
    until the applier encounters the *transaction commit* log event for the
    transaction.

  - *lastAvailableContinuousTick*: the last tick value the remote server can
    provide.

  - *ticksBehind*: this attribute will be present only if the applier is currently
    running. It will provide the number of log ticks between what the applier
    has applied/seen and the last log tick value provided by the remote server.
    If this value is zero, then both servers are in sync. If this is non-zero,
    then the remote server has additional data that the applier has not yet
    fetched and processed, or the remote server may have more data that is not
    applicable to the applier.
    
    Client applications can use it to determine approximately how far the applier
    is behind the remote server, and can periodically check if the value is 
    increasing (applier is falling behind) or decreasing (applier is catching up).
    
    Please note that as the remote server will only keep one last log tick value 
    for all of its databases, but replication may be restricted to just certain 
    databases on the applier, this value is more meaningful when the global applier 
    is used.
    Additionally, the last log tick provided by the remote server may increase
    due to writes into system collections that are not replicated due to replication
    configuration. So the reported value may exaggerate the reality a bit for
    some scenarios. 

  - *time*: the time on the applier server.

  - *totalRequests*: the total number of requests the applier has made to the
    endpoint.

  - *totalFailedConnects*: the total number of failed connection attempts the
    applier has made.

  - *totalEvents*: the total number of log events the applier has processed.

  - *totalOperationsExcluded*: the total number of log events excluded because
    of *restrictCollections*.

  - *progress*: a JSON object with details about the replication applier progress.
    It contains the following sub-attributes if there is progress to report:

    - *message*: a textual description of the progress

    - *time*: the date and time the progress was logged

    - *failedConnects*: the current number of failed connection attempts

  - *lastError*: a JSON object with details about the last error that happened on
    the applier. It contains the following sub-attributes if there was an error:

    - *errorNum*: a numerical error code

    - *errorMessage*: a textual error description

    - *time*: the date and time the error occurred

    In case no error has occurred, *lastError* will be empty.

- *server*: a JSON object with the following sub-attributes:

  - *version*: the applier server's version

  - *serverId*: the applier server's id

- *endpoint*: the endpoint the applier is connected to (if applier is
  active) or will connect to (if applier is currently inactive)

- *database*: the name of the database the applier is connected to (if applier is
  active) or will connect to (if applier is currently inactive)

Please note that all "tick" values returned do not have a specific unit. Tick
values are only meaningful when compared to each other. Higher tick values mean
"later in time" than lower tick values.

WARNING: calling this method will sychronize data from the collections found
on the remote master to the local ArangoDB database. All data in the local
collections will be purged and replaced with data from the master.

Use with caution!

Please also keep in mind that this command may take a long time to complete
and return. This is because it will first do a full data synchronization with
the master, which will take time roughly proportional to the amount of data.

**Note**: this method is not supported on a coordinator in a cluster.

@brief Create a new graph in the graph module.

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/gharial, Create a graph}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
The creation of a graph requires the name of the graph and a
definition of its edges.
[See also edge definitions](../../Manual/Graphs/GeneralGraphs/Management.html#edge-definitions).

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{waitForSync,boolean,optional}
define if the request should wait until everything is synced to disc.
Will change the success response code.

@RESTBODYPARAM{name,string,required,string}
Name of the graph.

@RESTBODYPARAM{edgeDefinitions,array,optional,graph_edge_definition}
An array of definitions for the relations of the graph.
Each has the following type:

@RESTBODYPARAM{isSmart,boolean,optional,boolean}
Define if the created graph should be smart.
This only has effect in Enterprise Edition.

@RESTBODYPARAM{options,object,optional,post_api_gharial_create_opts}
a JSON object to define options for creating collections within this graph.
It can contain the following attributes:

@RESTSTRUCT{smartGraphAttribute,post_api_gharial_create_opts,string,optional,}
Only has effect in Enterprise Edition and it is required if isSmart is true.
The attribute name that is used to smartly shard the vertices of a graph.
Every vertex in this SmartGraph has to have this attribute.
Cannot be modified later.

@RESTSTRUCT{numberOfShards,post_api_gharial_create_opts,integer,required,}
The number of shards that is used for every collection within this graph.
Cannot be modified later.

@RESTSTRUCT{replicationFactor,post_api_gharial_create_opts,integer,required,}
The replication factor used when initially creating collections for this graph.

@RESTSTRUCT{minReplicationFactor,post_api_gharial_create_opts,integer,optional,}
The minimal replication factor used for every new collection in the graph.
If one shard has less than minReplicationFactor copies, we cannot write
to this shard, but to all others.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
Is returned if the graph could be created and waitForSync is enabled
for the `_graphs` collection, or given in the request.
The response body contains the graph configuration that has been stored.

@RESTREPLYBODY{error,boolean,required,}
Flag if there was an error (true) or not (false).
It is false in this response.

@RESTREPLYBODY{code,integer,required,}
The response code.

@RESTREPLYBODY{graph,object,required,graph_representation}
The information about the newly created graph.

@RESTRETURNCODE{202}
Is returned if the graph could be created and waitForSync is disabled
for the `_graphs` collection and not given in the request.
The response body contains the graph configuration that has been stored.

@RESTREPLYBODY{error,boolean,required,}
Flag if there was an error (true) or not (false).
It is false in this response.

@RESTREPLYBODY{code,integer,required,}
The response code.

@RESTREPLYBODY{graph,object,required,graph_representation}
The information about the newly created graph.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
Returned if the request is in a wrong format.

@RESTREPLYBODY{error,boolean,required,}
Flag if there was an error (true) or not (false).
It is true in this response.

@RESTREPLYBODY{code,integer,required,}
The response code.

@RESTREPLYBODY{errorNum,integer,required,}
ArangoDB error number for the error that occured.

@RESTREPLYBODY{errorMessage,string,required,}
A message created for this error.

@RESTRETURNCODE{403}
Returned if your user has insufficient rights.
In order to create a graph you at least need to have the following privileges:

  1. `Administrate` access on the Database.
  2. `Read Only` access on every collection used within this graph.

@RESTREPLYBODY{error,boolean,required,}
Flag if there was an error (true) or not (false).
It is true in this response.

@RESTREPLYBODY{code,integer,required,}
The response code.

@RESTREPLYBODY{errorNum,integer,required,}
ArangoDB error number for the error that occured.

@RESTREPLYBODY{errorMessage,string,required,}
A message created for this error.

@RESTRETURNCODE{409}
Returned if there is a conflict storing the graph.  This can occur
either if a graph with this name is already stored, or if there is one
edge definition with a the same
[edge collection](../../Manual/Appendix/Glossary.html#edge-collection) but a
different signature used in any other graph.

@RESTREPLYBODY{error,boolean,required,}
Flag if there was an error (true) or not (false).
It is true in this response.

@RESTREPLYBODY{code,integer,required,}
The response code.

@brief Add a new edge definition to the graph

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/gharial/{graph}/edge, Add edge definition}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Adds an additional edge definition to the graph.

This edge definition has to contain a *collection* and an array of
each *from* and *to* vertex collections.  An edge definition can only
be added if this definition is either not used in any other graph, or
it is used with exactly the same definition. It is not possible to
store a definition "e" from "v1" to "v2" in the one graph, and "e"
from "v2" to "v1" in the other graph.

@RESTURLPARAMETERS

@RESTURLPARAM{graph,string,required}
The name of the graph.

@RESTBODYPARAM{collection,string,required,string}
The name of the edge collection to be used.

@RESTBODYPARAM{from,array,required,string}
One or many vertex collections that can contain source vertices.

@RESTBODYPARAM{to,array,required,string}
One or many vertex collections that can contain target vertices.

@RESTRETURNCODES
