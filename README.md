# ArangoDB
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/timoschilling/ArangoDB.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/timoschilling/ArangoDB)

We recently started a new open source project - a nosql database
called AvocadoDB which became ArangoDB in May 2012.  ArangoDB is
currently available as an alpha version. 
We want to have a stable version 1 ready soon. A multi server version is planned 
for the third quarter of 2012. For details see the roadmap.

Key features include:

* Schema-free schemata let you combine the space efficiency of MySQL with the performance power of NoSQL
* Use ArangoDB as an application server and fuse your application and database together for maximal throughput
* JavaScript for all: no language zoo, you can use one language from your browser to your back-end
* ArangoDB is multi-threaded - exploit the power of all your cores
* Flexible data modeling: model your data as combination of key-value pairs, documents or graphs - perfect for social relations
* Free index choice: use the correct index for your problem, be it a skip list or a n-gram search
* Configurable durability: let the application decide if it needs more durability or more performance
* No-nonsense storage: ArangoDB uses all of the power of modern storage hardware, like SSD and large caches
* Powerful query language (AQL) to retrieve data 
* It is open source (Apache Licence 2.0)

## Compilation

Please check the <a href="https://github.com/triAGENS/ArangoDB/wiki">wiki</a>
for installation and compilation instructions:

### Mac OS X Hints

On Mac OS X you can install ArangoDB using the packagemanager [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/):

* `brew install arangodb` (use `--HEAD` in order to build ArangoDB from current master)

This will install ArangoDB and all dependencies. Note that the server will be installed as

    /usr/local/sbin/arangod

The ArangoDB shell will be install as

    /usr/local/bin/arangosh

## First Steps

Start the server:

    > mkdir /tmp/vocbase
    > bin/arangod /tmp/vocbase
    2012-03-30T12:54:19Z [11794] INFO ArangoDB (version 1.x.y) is ready for business
    2012-03-30T12:54:19Z [11794] INFO Have Fun!

Start the shell in another windows:

    > bin/arangosh
                                           _     
      __ _ _ __ __ _ _ __   __ _  ___  ___| |__  
     / _` | '__/ _` | '_ \ / _` |/ _ \/ __| '_ \ 
    | (_| | | | (_| | | | | (_| | (_) \__ \ | | |
     \__,_|_|  \__,_|_| |_|\__, |\___/|___/_| |_|
                           |___/

## Caveat

Please note that this is a very early version of ArangoDB. There will be
bugs and we'd really appreciate it if you
