ArangoDB is a scalable open-source multi-model database natively supporting graph, document and search. All supported data models & access patterns can be combined in queries allowing for maximal flexibility. ArangoDB runs on prem, in the cloud – anywhere.

ArangoDB Cloud Service
------------------------

Oasis is the simplest way to run ArangoDB. Users can make deployments on all major cloud providers in many regions. Test [ArangoDBs Cloud Service Oasis](https://cloud.arangodb.com/home) for free.

Getting Started
------------------------

- [Free Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/getting-started-with-arangodb)
- [Training Center](https://www.arangodb.com/learn/)
- [Documentation](https://www.arangodb.com/docs/stable/)

For the impatient:

- Start the ArangoDB Docker container

      docker run -e ARANGO_ROOT_PASSWORD=test123 -p 8529:8529 -d arangodb/arangodb

- Alternatively, [download](https://www.arangodb.com/download) and install ArangoDB.
  Start the server `arangod` if the installer did not do it for you.

- Point your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:8529/`

Key Features in ArangoDB
------------------------

- **Multi-Model**: Documents, graphs and key-value pairs — model your data as
  you see fit for your application.
- **Joins**: Conveniently join what belongs together for flexible ad-hoc
  querying, less data redundancy.
- **Transactions**: Easy application development keeping your data consistent
  and safe. No hassle in your client.

Here is an AQL query that makes use of all those features:

![AQL Query Example](https://www.arangodb.com/docs/assets/aql_query_with_traversal.png)

Joins and transactions are key features for flexible, secure data designs,
widely used in relational databases but lacking in many NoSQL products. However,
there is no need to forgo them in ArangoDB. You decide how and when to use joins
and strong consistency guarantees, without sacrificing performance and scalability. 

Furthermore, ArangoDB offers a JavaScript framework called [Foxx](https://www.arangodb.com/community-server/foxx/)
that is executed in the database server with direct access to the data. Build your
own data-centric microservices with a few lines of code. By extending the HTTP API
with user code written in JavaScript, ArangoDB can be turned into a strict
schema-enforcing persistence engine.

Other features of ArangoDB include:

- Use a **data-centric microservices** approach with ArangoDB Foxx and fuse your
  application-logic and database together for maximal throughput
- JavaScript for all: **no language zoo**, you can use one language from your
  browser to your back-end
- **Flexible data modeling**: model your data as combination of key-value pairs,
  documents or graphs - perfect for social relations
- Different **storage engines**: ArangoDB provides a storage engine for mostly
  in-memory operations and an alternative storage engine based on RocksDB which 
  handle datasets that are much bigger than RAM.
- **Powerful query language** (AQL) to retrieve and modify data 
- **Transactions**: run queries on multiple documents or collections with
  optional transactional consistency and isolation
- **Replication** and **Sharding**: set up the database in a master-slave
  configuration or spread bigger datasets across multiple servers
- Configurable **durability**: let the application decide if it needs more
  durability or more performance
- **Schema-free schemata** let you combine the space efficiency of MySQL with the
  performance power of NoSQL
- **index support**: exploit the perfect index types for your different use cases, including document queries, graph queries, geo location queries, and fulltext searches
- ArangoDB is **multi-threaded** - exploit the power of all your cores
- Easy to use **web interface** and **command-line client tools** for interaction
  with the server
- It is **open source** (Apache License 2.0)
