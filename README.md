# AvocadoDB

My colleagues and I started developing a document-store, which focuses on durability 
of the data taking advantage of new technologies like SSD, support for graph and geo 
algorithms needed in social networks, ease of use for the developer and minimal 
effort to operate for the administrator. 

## Compilation

### Mac OS X Hints

On Mac OS X you can install AvocadoDB using the packagemanager [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/):

This will install AvocadoDB and all dependencies.

bugs and we'd realy appreciate it if you
