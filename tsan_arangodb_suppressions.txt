# A compiler optimization in DBImpl::ReleaseSnapshot() produces code where a
# register is populated with different addresses based on some condition, and
# this register is later read to populate the variable `oldest_snapshot`.
# However, this generated read is a non-atomic read, which therefore results in
# a false positive race warning. I have created an according GitHub issue:
