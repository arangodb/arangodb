# Enable pretty printers

See the `gdbinit` files (e.g. `./utils/gdb-pretty-printers/immer/gdbinit`) for an example to write in your `~/.gdbinit`
to load the pretty printers. Copy its content to (the end of your) `~/.gdbinit` file, and adapt the path passed
to `sys.path.insert`.

# Run tests

Run `./utils/build_and_run_tests.sh` to test the pretty printers. The tests currently don't run automatically in the CI.
I've tested them only on Linux.

It's to be expected that the tests might break if not built with `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` (we're testing `gdb`, after
all).

The tests also rely on a pretty-printer for `std::string` of the installed stdlib to be installed, and to pretty-print
a `std::string{"hello, world"}` as `"hello, world"` (the ones I have for `libstdc++` and `libc++` both do).

# Extend tests

The `flex_vector_test` is executed by `ctest`, and consists of two files. `flex_vector_test.cpp`, which sets up
both `testee` and `expected` data structures. And `flex_vector_test.gdbscript`, which runs the `flex_vector` pretty
printer on each `testee` and compares it to `expected`.

# Future work

Currently there's only one pretty printer, for `immer::flex_vector` (to be precise, there's also one
for `immer::details::rbts::rrbtree`, which is the implementation of `immer::flex_vector`). We might want to include the
existing VelocyPack one, and possibly add more later.
