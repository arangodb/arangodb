<ul class="arangodbSlider">
<li>ArangoDB supports the Blueprints standards for graph databases. Blueprints is analogous to JDBC, but for graph databases.</li>
<li style="display:none">Foxx, ArangoDB's JS application framework, comes in handy for applications where most of the business logic is done by the frontend (like a mobile app). Foxx lets you set up a lean secure backend in very short time.</li>
<li style="display:none">ArangoDB 1.4 comes with an asynchronous job queue. You can pass tasks to 3rd party software (like ruby, node.js) and the result can be retrieved by the client later via the asynchronous request API.</li>
</ul>
