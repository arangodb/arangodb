****** ArangoDB ******

ArangoDB is a multi-model, open-source database with flexible data models for
documents, graphs, and key-values. Build high performance applications using a
convenient SQL-like query language or JavaScript extensions. Use ACID
transactions if you require them. Scale horizontally with a few mouse clicks.
The supported data models can be mixed in queries and allow ArangoDB to be the
aggregation point for your data.
To get started, try one of our 10 minutes tutorials in your favorite
programming language or try one of our ArangoDB_Cookbook_recipes.
For the impatient: download and install ArangoDB. Start the server arangod and
point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8529/.

***** Key Features in ArangoDB *****

    * Multi-Model: Documents, graphs and key-value pairs â€” model your data as
      you see fit for your application.
    * Joins: Conveniently join what belongs together for flexible ad-hoc
      querying, less data redundancy.
    * Transactions: Easy application development keeping your data consistent
      and safe. No hassle in your client.
Here is an AQL query that makes use of all those features:
[AQL Query Example]
Joins and transactions are key features for flexible, secure data designs,
widely used in relational databases but lacking in many NoSQL products.
However, there is no need to forgo them in ArangoDB. You decide how and when to
use joins and strong consistency guarantees, without sacrificing performance
and scalability.
Furthermore, ArangoDB offers a JavaScript framework called Foxx that is
executed in the database server with direct access to the data. Build your own
data-centric microservices with a few lines of code:
Microservice Example
[Microservice Example]
By extending the HTTP API with user code written in JavaScript, ArangoDB can be
turned into a strict schema-enforcing persistence engine.
Next step, bundle your Foxx application as a docker_container and get it
running in the cloud.
Other features of ArangoDB include:
    * Use a data-centric microservices approach with ArangoDB Foxx and fuse
      your application-logic and database together for maximal throughput
    * JavaScript for all: no language zoo, you can use one language from your
      browser to your back-end
    * Flexible data modeling: model your data as combination of key-value
      pairs, documents or graphs - perfect for social relations
    * Different storage engines: ArangoDB provides a storage engine for mostly
      in-memory operations and an alternative storage engine based on RocksDB
      which handle datasets that are much bigger than RAM.
    * Powerful query language (AQL) to retrieve and modify data
    * Transactions: run queries on multiple documents or collections with
      optional transactional consistency and isolation
    * Replication and Sharding: set up the database in a master-slave
      configuration or spread bigger datasets across multiple servers
    * Configurable durability: let the application decide if it needs more
      durability or more performance
    * Schema-free schemata let you combine the space efficiency of MySQL with
      the performance power of NoSQL
    * Free index choice: use the correct index for your problem, be it a
      skiplist or a fulltext search
    * ArangoDB is multi-threaded - exploit the power of all your cores
    * It is open source (Apache License 2.0)
