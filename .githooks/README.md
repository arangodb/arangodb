# Using commit hooks

We automatically check the C++ code that is pushed to our repository for correct 
formatting. There is a GitHub Action running for all pushes that runs a code
formatting check that is based on clang-format.
This check will flag non-correctly formatted code as broken.

To make sure only correctly formatted code is pushed to GitHub, it is recommended
to install a Git pre-commit hook that checks every local commit for correct code
formatting.

In this directory, we provide the [commit hook](pre-commit). It can be installed by
copying the `pre-commit` file from this directory to `.git/hooks/pre-commit`.
Please note that there is also a separate commit hook for the enterprise repository,
which should be copied to `enterprise/.git/hooks/pre-commit`.

The commit hook will automatically verify that all to-be-committed files are
correctly formatted, and will abort the commit process in case of a formatting
violation.
Note that git will invoke the pre-commit check for all added files, which is exactly
what one normally wants. However, when using `git commit -a`, the pre-commit check
is executed by git **before** adding the files. Thus the pre-commit check may run
on an outdated version of the files that `git commit -a` will add. The usage of
`git commit -a` is thus not supported with this pre-commit check (`git commit -a`
should be avoided for other reasons, too...).

To apply correct formatting, it is possible to run a
[script](../scripts/clang-format.sh) that we provide:
- `./scripts/clang-format.sh` in Bash on Linux and macOS
- `.\scripts\clang-format.ps1` in PowerShell on Windows (wrapper for `clang-format.sh`)

After running this script, the code should be correctly formatted. It is then
necessary to stage the formatting changes and commit again.

Note that if you want to reformat an existing file, you manually invoke 
`scripts/clang-format.sh` on it, by passing it a filename or a directory name.
