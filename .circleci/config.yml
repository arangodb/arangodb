# NOTE:
#
# This file has been added to 3.10, 3.9, and 3.8 stable branches to prevent
# CircleCI's Github integration from spamming PRs that are opened from these
# branches with failures.
#
# For CircleCI to run successful testing on this branch the test setup from
# the devel branch will have to be ported.
