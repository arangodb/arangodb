// This file provides a few functions for hashing strings.  All of them are
// high-quality functions in the sense that they pass standard tests such
// as Austin Appleby's SMHasher.  They are also fast.
//
// For 64-bit x86 code, on short strings, we don't know of anything faster than
// CityHash64 that is of comparable quality.  We believe our nearest competitor
// is Murmur3.  For 64-bit x86 code, CityHash64 is an excellent choice for hash
// tables and most other hashing (excluding cryptography).
//
// For 32-bit x86 code, we don't know of anything faster than CityHash32 that
// is of comparable quality.  We believe our nearest competitor is Murmur3A.
// (On 64-bit CPUs, it is typically faster to use the other CityHash variants.)
//
// Functions in the CityHash family are not suitable for cryptography.
//
// Please see CityHash's README file for more details on our performance
// measurements and so on.
//
// WARNING: This code has been only lightly tested on big-endian platforms!
// It is known to work well on little-endian platforms that have a small penalty
// for unaligned reads, such as current Intel and AMD moderate-to-high-end CPUs.
// It should work on all 32-bit and 64-bit platforms that allow unaligned reads;
// bug reports are welcome.
//
// By the way, for some hash functions, given strings a and b, the hash
// of a+b is easily derived from the hashes of a and b.  This property
// doesn't hold for any hash functions in this file.
