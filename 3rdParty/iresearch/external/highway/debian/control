Description: Efficient and performance-portable SIMD wrapper (developer files)
 This library provides type-safe and source-code portable wrappers over
 existing platform-specific intrinsics. Its design aims for simplicity,
 reliable efficiency across platforms, and immediate usability with current
 compilers.
 .
 This package installs the development files. There's no runtime library
 since most of Highway is implemented in headers and only a very small
 static library is needed.
