# text

### Motivation
C and C++ are the only major production languages that do not have robust Unicode support. This library attempts to provide that support for C++.

This library provides a Unicode implementation suitable for use by anyone â€” including those who know next to nothing about Unicode.

### Features
- Iterators, views, and algorithms that convert among UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32.

- An implementation of the Unicode algorithms for dealing with encodings, normalization, text segmentation, etc.

- A family of types for use in Unicode-aware text processing. This includes text, text_view, rope, and rope_view.

- Code familiarity -- all of the above types and algorithms work like the STL containers and algorithms.

This library targets submission to Boost and eventual standardization.

It's more interesting than it sounds.
