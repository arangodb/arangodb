[section Configuration]

You can define _string_max_m_ to be the size in bytes that you want as the
limit on the size of _ur_ and _r_ nodes when doing in-place insertions.

_Text_ will automatically use concepts to constrain templates when building in
C++20 mode, if the compiler defines `__cpp_lib_concepts`.  To disable the use
of concepts, define _disable_concepts_m_.

_Text_ will automatically use coroutines when building in C++20 mode, if the
compiler defines `__cpp_coroutines`.  To disable the use of coroutines, define
_disable_coroutines_m_.
