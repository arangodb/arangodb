[section Intro]

[heading Motivation]

C and C++ are the only major production languages that do not have robust
Unicode support.  This library attempts to provide that support for C++.

This library provides a Unicode implementation suitable for use by anyone
_emdash_ including those who know next to nothing about Unicode.


[heading Features]

- Iterators, views, and algorithms that convert among UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32.

- An implementation of the Unicode algorithms for dealing with encodings,
  normalization, text segmentation, etc.

- A family of types for use in Unicode-aware text processing.  This includes
  _t_, _tv_, _r_, and _rv_.

- Code familiarity -- all of the above types and algorithms work like the STL
  containers and algorithms.
