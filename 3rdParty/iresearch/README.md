## Overview
The IResearch library is meant to be treated as a standalone index that is capable of both indexing and storing individual values verbatim.
Indexed data is treated on a per-version/per-revision basis, i.e. existing data version/revision is never modified and updates/removals
are treated as new versions/revisions of the said data. This allows for trivial multi-threaded read/write operations on the index.
The index exposes its data processing functionality via a multi-threaded 'writer' interface that treats each document abstraction as a
collection of fields to index and/or store.
The index exposes its data retrieval functionality via 'reader' interface that returns records from an index matching a specified query.
The queries themselves are constructed from either string IQL (index query language) requests or query trees built directly using the query
building blocks available in the API.
The querying infrastructure provides the capability of ordering the result set by one or more ranking/scoring implementations.
The ranking/scoring implementation logic is plugin-based and lazy-initialized during runtime as needed, allowing for addition of custom
ranking/scoring logic without the need to even recompile the IResearch library.


## High level architecture and main concepts
### Index
An index consists of multiple independent parts, called segments and index metadata. Index metadata stores information about
active index segments for the particular index version/revision.  Each index segment is an index itself and consists of the
following logical components:

- segment metadata
- field metadata
- term dictionary
- postings lists
- list of deleted documents
- stored values

Read/write access to the components carried via plugin-based formats. Index may contain segments created using different formats.

### Document
A database record is represented as an abstraction called a document.
A document is actually a collection of indexed/stored fields.
In order to be processed each field should satisfy at least `IndexedField` or `StoredField` concept.

#### IndexedField concept
For type `T` to be `IndexedField`, the following conditions have to be satisfied for an object m of type `T`:

|Expression|Requires|Effects|
|----|----|----|
|`m.name()`|The output type must be convertible to `iresearch::string_ref`|A value uses as a key name.|
|`m.get_tokens()`|The output type must be convertible to `iresearch::token_stream*`|A token stream uses for populating in invert procedure. If value is `nullptr` field is treated as non-indexed.|
|`m.features()`|The output type must be convertible to `const iresearch::flags&`|A set of features requested for evaluation during indexing. E.g. it may contain request of processing positions and frequencies. Later the evaluated information can be used during querying.|

#### StoredField concept
For type `T` to be `StoredField`, the following conditions have to be satisfied for an object m of type `T`:

|Expression|Requires|Effects|
|----|----|----|
|`m.name()`|The output type must be convertible to `iresearch::string_ref`|A value uses as a key name.|
|`m.write(iresearch::data_output& out)`|The output type must be convertible to bool.|One may write arbitrary data to stream denoted by `out` in order to retrieve written value using index_reader API later. If nothing has written but returned value is `true` then stored value is treated as flag. If returned value is `false` then nothing is stored even if something has been written to `out` stream.|

### Directory
A data storage abstraction that can either store data in memory or on the filesystem depending on which implementation is instantiated.
A directory stores at least all the currently in-use index data versions/revisions. For the case where there are no active users of the
directory then at least the last data version/revision is stored. Unused data versions/revisions may be removed via the directory_cleaner.
A single version/revision of the index is composed of one or more segments associated, and possibly shared, with the said version/revision.

### Writer
A single instance per-directory object that is used for indexing data. Data may be indexed in a per-document basis or sourced from
another reader for trivial directory merge functionality.
Each `commit()` of a writer produces a new version/revision of the view of the data in the corresponding directory.
Additionally the interface also provides directory defragmentation capabilities to allow compacting multiple smaller version/revision
segments into larger more compact representations.
A writer supports two-phase transactions via `begin()`/`commit()`/`rollback()` methods.

### Reader
A reusable/refreshable view of an index at a given point in time. Multiple readers can use the same directory and may point to different
versions/revisions of data in the said directory.

## Included 3rd party dependencies
Code for all included 3rd party dependencies is located in the "external" directory.
#### [MurMurHash](https://sites.google.com/site/murmurhash)
used for fast computation of hashes for byte arrays
#### [OpenFST](http://www.openfst.org/twiki/bin/view/FST/WebHome)

in memory even for huge dictionaries

## External 3rd party dependencies
External 3rd party dependencies must be made available to the IResearch library separately.
They may either be installed through the distribution package management system or build
from source and the appropriate environment variables set accordingly.

matching of words from languages not supported by 'snowball' are done verbatim

### [Google Test](https://code.google.com/p/googletest)

https://github.com/snowballstem/snowball-website/tree/master/algorithms/*/stop.txt
https://code.google.com/p/stop-words/
or create a custom language-specific list of stopwords
place the files with stopwords, (utf8 encoded with one word per line, any text after
the first whitespace is ignored), in the directory corresponding to its language
(multiple files per language are supported and will be interpreted as a single list)


## Query filter building blocks
| Filter    |       Description    |          
|-----------|----------------------|
|iresearch::by_granular_range|for faster filtering of numeric values within a given range, with the possibility of specifying open/closed ranges
|iresearch::by_phrase|for word-position-sensitive filtering of values, with the possibility of skipping selected positions
|iresearch::by_prefix|for filtering of exact value prefixes
|iresearch::by_range|for filtering of values within a given range, with the possibility of specifying open/closed ranges
|iresearch::by_same_position|for term-insertion-order sensitive filtering of exact values
|iresearch::by_term|for filtering of exact values
|iresearch::And|boolean conjunction of multiple filters, influencing document ranks/scores as appropriate
|iresearch::Or|boolean disjunction of multiple filters, influencing document ranks/scores as appropriate (including "minimum match" functionality)
|iresearch::Not|boolean negation of multiple filters

## Index Query Language
The IResearch index may be queries either via query trees built directly using the query building blocks available
in the API or via the IQL query builder that generates a comparable query from a string representation of the query
expressed using the IQL syntax.

#### API
The IQL parser is defined via Bison grammar and is accessible via <b>iresearch::iql::parser</b>
and <b>iresearch::iql::parser_context</b> classes. The latter class is intended to be extended to expose at least the
following methods as required:
- query_state current_state() const;
- query_node const& find_node(parser::semantic_type const& value) const;

The <b>iresearch::iql::parser_context::query_state</b> object provides access to the results of the query parsing as well
as any parse errors reported by Bison.
- nOffset  - next offset position to be parsed (size_t)
- pnFilter - the filter portion (nodeID) of the query, or nullptr if unset (size_t const*)
- order    - the order portion (nodeID, ascending) of the query (std::vector<std::pair<size_t, bool>> const&)
- pnLimit  - the limit value of the query, or nullptr if unset (size_t const*)
- pError   - the last encountered error, or nullptr if no errors seen (iresearch::iql::query_position const*)


#### Grammar
The following grammar is currently defined via Bison (the root is <query>):
```
