[section:section_faq Frequently Asked Questions]

[h3 Where the latest version of the Boost Test Library is located?]
The latest version of Boost Test Library is available online at [@http://www.boost.org/libs/test].

[h3 I found a bug. Where can I report it?]
You can send a bug report to the boost users' mailing list and/or fill a ticket here [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/].

 
[h3 I have a request for a new feature. Where can I ask for it?]
You can send a request to the boost developers' mailing list and/or and/or fill a ticket here [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/].


[h3 How to create test case using the Unit Test Framework?]
To create a test case, use the macro
 
  __BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE__( test_function );

For more details see the Unit Test Framework __BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE__ documentation.

[h3 How to create test suite using the Unit Test Framework?]
To create a test suite use the macro
 
  __BOOST_AUTO_TEST_SUITE__( suite_name );

For more details see the Unit Test Framework __BOOST_AUTO_TEST_SUITE__ documentation.

 
[h3 Why did I get a linker error when compiling my test program?]

Boost Test Library components provide several usage variants: to create a test program you can
link with the one of the precompiled library variants or use single-header variant. For example, to use Unit Test
Framework you may either include

``
  #include <boost/test/unit_test.hpp>
``
and link with ``libunit_test_framework.lib`` or you can include

``
 #include <boost/test/included/unit_test.hpp>
``

in which case you should not need to link with any precompiled component. Note also that
you should strictly follow specification on initialization function in other case some compilers may produce linker
error like this.

``
  Unresolved external init_unit_test_suite(int, char**).
``
 

The reason for this error is that in your implementation you should specify second argument of
`init_unit_test_suite` exactly as in the specification, i.e.: `char* []`.

[h3 How can I redirect testing output?]
Use ``unit_test_log::instance().set_log_output( std::ostream & )``
For more details see the __UTF__ __output_test_stream_tool__ documentation.

[h3 I want different default log trace level]
Use environment variable __BOOST_TEST_LOG_LEVEL__ to define desired log trace level. You still will be able to reset
this value from the command line. For the list of acceptable values see the __UTF__
__runtime_configuration__ documentation.

[h3 Is there DLL version of Boost.Test components available on Win32 platform?]
Yes. Starting with Boost 1.34.0.


[h3 How to set up a CMake project using __UTF__ (extended)]

Suppose, you are building a test module from one translation unit `test_file.cpp`. First, let's do it using the [link boost_test.usage_variants.single_header single-header usage variant] of the __UTF__.

Let's paste the following content in a `CMakeLists.txt` 
at the same location than our test file `test_file.cpp`:

[pre
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.7)
project(my_first_test)
enable_testing()

# indicates the location of the boost installation tree.
# hard-coded for our simple example.
set(BOOST_INCLUDE_DIRS $boost_installation_prefix/include)

# creates the executable
add_executable(test_executable test_file.cpp)
# indicates the include paths
target_include_directories(test_executable PRIVATE ${BOOST_INCLUDE_DIRS})

# declares a test with our executable
add_test(NAME test1 COMMAND test_executable)
]

We will now create the build directory for this project (separate directory), 
configure and build the project, as follow:
```
> cd ``$``test_path
> mkdir build     /*< we create a directory dedicated to the build, to avoid 
                      any pollution of the sources with the temporary
                      build files >*/
> cd build
> cmake  ..       /*< configuration of the project >*/
> cmake --build . /*< this command builds the project, cmake drives a native 
                      tool that is configured on the previous command line >*/
> ctest           /*< runs the tests declared in the project and prints a report >*/
```

In the case you are using the [link boost_test.usage_variants.shared_lib shared libraries] variant of __UTF__, 
some modifications should be done in your CMakeLists.txt. 

[pre
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.11)
project(my_first_test)
enable_testing()

# replace XX with the version you have
set(Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS "1.XX" "1.XX.0")

# finds boost, triggers an error otherwise
find_package(Boost XX REQUIRED COMPONENTS unit_test_framework)

# creates the executable
add_executable(test_executable test_file.cpp)
# indicates the include paths
target_include_directories(test_executable PRIVATE ${Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS})
# indicates the shared library variant
target_compile_definitions(test_executable PRIVATE "BOOST_TEST_DYN_LINK=1")
# indicates the link paths
target_link_libraries(test_executable ${Boost_UNIT_TEST_FRAMEWORK_LIBRARY})

# declares a test with our executable
add_test(NAME test1 COMMAND test_executable)

]

We will now create the build directory for this project (separate directory), configure and build the project,
as follow:
```
> cd ``$``test_path
> mkdir build /*< we create a directory dedicated to the build, to avoid any pollution of the sources with the temporary
                  build files >*/
> cd build
> cmake -DBOOST_ROOT=``$``boost_installation_prefix .. /*< configuration of the project, the `BOOST_ROOT` configuration element indicates the 
                                                           Boost module of `cmake` where to find our installation >*/
> cmake --build . /*< this command builds the project, cmake drives a native tool that is configured on the 
                      previous command line >*/
> ctest           /*< runs the tests declared in the project and prints a report >*/
```
