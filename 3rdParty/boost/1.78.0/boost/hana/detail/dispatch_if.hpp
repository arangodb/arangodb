    //! @ingroup group-details
    //! Dispatch to the given implementation method only when a condition is
    //! satisfied.
    //!
    //! If the condition is satisfied, this macro is equivalent to the type
    //! `IMPL`. Otherwise, it is equivalent to a type with a deleted static
    //! function named `apply`. When a tag-dispatching error happens, the
    //! condition should be false and the deleted static function `apply`
    //! will prevent the compiler from generating too much garbage.
    //!
    //! @note
    //! When `BOOST_HANA_CONFIG_DISABLE_CONCEPT_CHECKS` is defined, the
    //! condition is always ignored and this macro expands to the
    //! implementation only.
    //!
    //! @remark
    //! This must be implemented as a macro, because we don't want the
    //! condition to be evaluated at all when
    //! `BOOST_HANA_CONFIG_DISABLE_CONCEPT_CHECKS` is defined.
