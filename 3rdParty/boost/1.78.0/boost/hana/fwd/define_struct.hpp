    // Note:
    // The weird definition as a variable seems to exploit a glitch in Doxygen
    // which makes the macro appear in the related objects of Struct (as we
    // want it to).

    //! Defines members of a structure, while at the same time
    //! modeling `Struct`.
    //! @ingroup group-Struct
    //!
    //! Using this macro in the body of a user-defined type will define the
    //! given members inside that type, and will also provide a model of the
    //! `Struct` concept for that user-defined type. This macro is often the
    //! easiest way to define a model of the `Struct` concept.
    //!
    //! @note
    //! This macro only works if the tag of the user-defined type `T` is `T`
    //! itself. This is the case unless you specifically asked for something
    //! different; see `tag_of`'s documentation.
    //!
    //!
    //! Example
    //! -------
    //! @include example/define_struct.cpp
