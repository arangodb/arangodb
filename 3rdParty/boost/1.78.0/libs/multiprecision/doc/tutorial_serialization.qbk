[section:serial Boost.Serialization Support]

Support for serialization comes in two forms:

* Classes __number, __debug_adaptor, __logged_adaptor and __rational_adaptor have "pass through" serialization
support which requires the underlying backend to be serializable.
* Backends __cpp_int, __cpp_bin_float, __cpp_dec_float and __float128__ have full support for Boost.Serialization.
