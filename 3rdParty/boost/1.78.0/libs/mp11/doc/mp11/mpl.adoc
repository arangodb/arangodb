# MPL Support, <boost/mp11/mpl.hpp>
:toc:
:toc-title:
:idprefix:

The header `<boost/mp11/mpl.hpp>`, when included, defines the
necessary support infrastructure for `mp_list` and `std::tuple`
to be valid link:../../../../libs/mpl[MPL] sequences.

NOTE: `mpl.hpp` is not included by `<boost/mp11.hpp>`.

It's also possible to only enable support for `mp_list` by
including `<boost/mp11/mpl_list.hpp>`, and for `std::tuple`
by including `<boost/mp11/mpl_tuple.hpp>`. This may be required
because some libraries, such as Boost.Fusion, contain their own MPL
support for `std::tuple`, which conflicts with Mp11's one.

.Converting an existing MPL Sequence into an mp_list
```
using L = mpl::copy<Sequence, mpl::back_inserter<mp11::mp_list<>>>::type;
```
