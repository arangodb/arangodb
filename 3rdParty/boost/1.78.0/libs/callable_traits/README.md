# Boost.CallableTraits <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/boostorg/callable_traits/actions/workflows/ci.yml">![CI][badge.CI]</a>

CallableTraits is a standalone C++11 header-only library for the inspection, synthesis, and decomposition of callable types. Language features added in later C++ standards are also supported.

The latest documentation is available [here](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/master/libs/callable_traits/doc/html/index.html).

CallableTraits is released as part of the [Boost C++ Libraries](http://www.boost.org/). Since it only depends on the standard library headers, you can also download it as a standalone library [here](https://github.com/boostorg/callable_traits/releases/latest).
