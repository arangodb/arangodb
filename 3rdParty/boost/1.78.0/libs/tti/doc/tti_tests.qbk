[section:tti_tests Testing TTI]

In the libs/tti/test subdirectory there is a jamfile 
which can be used to test TTI functionality.

Executing the jamfile without a target, or specifying the target 
'tti', will run tests for both basic TTI and for the variadic macro 
portion of TTI. You can run tests for only the basic TTI, 
which is the vast majority of TTI functionality, by specifying 
only the 'ttinovm' target when executing the jamfile. If you 
just want to run the tests for the variadic macro portion 
of TTI, specify the target as 'ttivm'.

The TTI library has been successfully tested with:

* VC++ 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14.0, 14.1, 14.2
* gcc 3.4.2 through 9.2
* clang 2.8 through 9.0
* Intel-linux 12.1 through 19.0
