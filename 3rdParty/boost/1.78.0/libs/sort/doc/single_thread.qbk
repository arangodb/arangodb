* *spreadsort* is an extremely fast hybrid radix sort algorithm, designed and developed by Steven Ross.

* *pdqsort* is a improvement of the quick sort algorithm, designed and developed by Orson Peters.

* *spinsort* is a stable sort that is fast with random or nearly sorted data, designed and developed by Francisco Tapia.

* *flat_stable_sort* is a stable sort that uses very little additional memory (around 1% of the size of the data), providing 80% - 90% of the speed of
 spinsort, designed and developed by Francisco Tapia.
