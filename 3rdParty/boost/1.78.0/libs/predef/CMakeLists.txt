# NOTE:
#   CMake support for Boost.Predef is currently experimental at best and the
#   interface is likely to change in the future
#
# This file provides minimal cmake support (no unit-tests,
# no installation) for integration into a "host" cmake project
# via the "add_subdirectory( <path-to-boost-predef> )" command.
#
# Other cmake targets can then use the public target name
# "Boost::predef" in order to express their dependency
# on this library. I.e:
#
# target_link_libraries( <my-exe/lib> PUBLIC Boost::predef )

# Only need the basic minimum of project, add_library, and
# target_include_directories commands.
cmake_minimum_required( VERSION 3.0 )

# Don't set VERSION, as that's a pita to keep up to date with the version
# header. And don't set LANGUAGES as we are multi-language and header
# only, so it's irrelevant.
project( BoostPredef LANGUAGES NONE )

# Simple INTERFACE, and header only, library target.
add_library( boost_predef INTERFACE )

# The only usage requirement is include dir for consumers.
target_include_directories( boost_predef INTERFACE include )

# Add an alias to be compatible with consumers that may have used the
# FindBoost script.
add_library( Boost::predef ALIAS boost_predef )
