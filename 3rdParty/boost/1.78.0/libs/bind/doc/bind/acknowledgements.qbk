Earlier efforts that have influenced the library design:

* The [@http://staff.cs.utu.fi/BL/ Binder Library] by Jaakko J\u00E4rvi;

* The [@boost:/libs/lambda/index.html Lambda Library] (now part of Boost) by
  Jaakko J\u00E4rvi and Gary Powell (the successor to the Binder Library);

* [@http://more.sourceforge.net/ Extensions to the STL] by Petter Urkedal.

Doug Gregor suggested that a visitor mechanism would allow `bind` to
interoperate with a signal/slot library.

John Maddock fixed a MSVC-specific conflict between `bind` and the
[@boost:/libs/type_traits/index.html type traits library].

Numerous improvements were suggested during the formal review period by Ross
Smith, Richard Crossley, Jens Maurer, Ed Brey, and others. Review manager was
Darin Adler.

The precise semantics of `bind` were refined in discussions with Jaakko
J\u00E4rvi.

Dave Abrahams fixed a MSVC-specific conflict between `bind` and the
[@boost:/libs/utility/iterator_adaptors.htm iterator adaptors library].

Dave Abrahams modified `bind` and `mem_fn` to support `void` returns on
deficient compilers.

Mac Murrett contributed the "pascal" support enabled by
`BOOST_BIND_ENABLE_PASCAL`.

The alternative `bind(type<R>(), f, ...)` syntax was inspired by a discussion
with Dave Abrahams and Joel de Guzman.

This documentation was ported to Quickbook by Agustín Bergé.
