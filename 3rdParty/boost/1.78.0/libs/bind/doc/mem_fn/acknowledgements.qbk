[section:acknowledgements Acknowledgements]

* Rene Jager's initial suggestion of using traits classes to make `mem_fn`
adapt to user-defined smart pointers inspired the `get_pointer`-based design.

* Numerous improvements were suggested during the formal review period by
Richard Crossley, Jens Maurer, Ed Brey, and others. Review manager was Darin
Adler.

* Steve Anichini pointed out that COM interfaces use `__stdcall`.

* Dave Abrahams modified `bind` and `mem_fn` to support `void` returns on
deficient compilers.

* Daniel Boelzle pointed out that UDK uses `__cdecl`.

This documentation was ported to Quickbook by Agustín Bergé.
