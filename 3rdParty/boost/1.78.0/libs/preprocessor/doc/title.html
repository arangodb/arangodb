    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <div> The Boost Preprocessing library is a library of macros, with
      support for preprocessor metaprogramming. The library supports
      both C++ and C compilation. It does not depend on any other Boost
      libraries and therefore may be used as a standalone library.<br>
    </div>
    <div>The library requires that the compiler supports <a
        href="topics/variadic_macros.html">variadic macros</a>. Since
      variadic macros are a C99 or C++11 feature the library ostensibly
      requires at least compilation at those C or C++ standard levels. A
      number of compilers support variadic macros at a lower level, so
      it still may be possible using the library at that compilation
      level, as long as strict C++98/C++03 compliance is not enforced.<br>
    </div>
    <div> An excerpt from <i>C++ Template Metaprogramming: Concepts,
        Tools, and Techniques from Boost and Beyond</i> by Dave Abrahams
      and Aleksey Gurtovoy has been made <a
        href="AppendixA-AnIntroductiontoPreprocessorMetaprogramming.html"
        target="_top"><font color="blue"><b><u><i>available</i></u></b></font></a>.
      This excerpt contains a basic introduction to the Preprocessor
      library and preprocessor metaprogramming which may help users new
      to the library and users interested in seeing some of the
      facilities offered by the library. </div>
