[section Configuration Preprocessor Definitions]

A number of configuration preprocessor definitions can be used to change
the behavior of Beast.
The user should assume that they introduce significant changes to the public part
of this library's API and make sure that all translation units (usually files)
compiled and linked into a program use the same combination of configuration macros,
failure to do so may result in violations of ODR (One Definition Rule).

[table Special Fields
[[Definition][Description]]
[
    [
        BOOST_BEAST_USE_STD_STRING_VIEW
    ][
        Causes Beast to use std::string_view instead of boost::string_view.
        Requires C++17.
    ]
]
[
    [
        BOOST_BEAST_SEPARATE_COMPILATION
    ][
        Enables the split compilation mode, which allows the user to compile
        definitions of non-template entities in a single translation unit, thus
        improving compilation speed. That translation unit has to include
        boost/beast/src.hpp in order to compile the definitions.

[
    [
        BOOST_BEAST_ALLOW_DEPRECATED
    ][
        Enables the use of deprecated APIs within Beast.
