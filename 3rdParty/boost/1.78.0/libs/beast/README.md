## Introduction

Beast is a C++ header-only library serving as a foundation for writing
interoperable networking libraries by providing **low-level HTTP/1,
WebSocket, and networking protocol** vocabulary types and algorithms
using the consistent asynchronous model of Boost.Asio.

This library is designed for:

* **Symmetry:** Algorithms are role-agnostic; build clients, servers, or both.

* **Ease of Use:** Boost.Asio users will immediately understand Beast.

* **Flexibility:** Users make the important decisions such as buffer or
  thread management.

* **Performance:** Build applications handling thousands of connections or more.

* **Basis for Further Abstraction.** Components are well-suited for building upon.

## Description

This software is in its first official release. Interfaces
may change in response to user feedback. For recent changes
see the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

* [Official Site](https://github.com/boostorg/beast)
* [Documentation](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/master/libs/beast/) (master branch)
* [Autobahn|Testsuite WebSocket Results](https://vinniefalco.github.io/boost/beast/reports/autobahn/index.html)

## Requirements

This library is for programmers familiar with Boost.Asio. Users
who wish to use asynchronous interfaces should already know how to
create concurrent network programs using callbacks or coroutines.

* **C++11:** Robust support for most language features.
* **Boost:** Boost.Asio and some other parts of Boost.
* **OpenSSL:** Required for using TLS/Secure sockets and examples/tests

When using Microsoft Visual C++, Visual Studio 2017 or later is required.

One of these components is required in order to build the tests and examples:

* Properly configured bjam/b2
* CMake 3.5.1 or later (Windows only)

## Building

Beast is header-only. To use it just add the necessary `#include` line
to your source files, like this:
```C++
#include <boost/beast.hpp>
```

If you use coroutines you'll need to link with the Boost.Coroutine
library. Please visit the Boost documentation for instructions
on how to do this for your particular build system.

## GitHub

To use the latest official release of Beast, simply obtain the latest
Boost distribution and follow the instructions for integrating it
into your development environment. If you wish to build the examples
and tests, or if you wish to preview upcoming changes and features,
it is suggested to clone the "Boost superproject" and work with Beast
"in-tree" (meaning, the libs/beast subdirectory of the superproject).

The official repository contains the following branches:

* [**master**](https://github.com/boostorg/beast/tree/master) This
  holds the most recent snapshot with code that is known to be stable.

* [**develop**](https://github.com/boostorg/beast/tree/develop) This
  holds the most recent snapshot. It may contain unstable code.

Each of these branches requires a corresponding Boost branch and
all of its subprojects. For example, if you wish to use the **master**
branch version of Beast, you should clone the Boost superproject,
switch to the **master** branch in the superproject and acquire
all the Boost libraries corresponding to that branch including Beast.

To clone the superproject locally, and switch into the main project's
directory use:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/boostorg/boost.git
cd boost
```

"bjam" is used to build Beast and the Boost libraries. On a non-Windows
system use this command to build bjam:
```
./bootstrap.sh
```

From a Windows command line, build bjam using this command:
```
.\BOOTSTRAP.BAT
```

## Building tests and examples
Building tests and examples requires OpenSSL installed. If OpenSSL is installed
in a non-system location, you will need to copy the
[user-config.jam](tools/user-config.jam) file into your home directory and set
the `OPENSSL_ROOT` environment variable to the path that contains an installation
of OpenSSL.

### Ubuntu/Debian
If installed into a system directory, OpenSSL will be automatically found and used.
```bash
sudo apt install libssl-dev
```
### Windows
Replace `path` in the following code snippets with the path you installed vcpkg
to. Examples assume a 32-bit build, if you build a 64-bit version replace
`x32-windows` with `x64-windows` in the path.
- Using [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) and CMD:
```bat
vcpkg install openssl --triplet x32-windows
SET OPENSSL_ROOT=path\installed\x32-windows
```

- Using [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) and PowerShell:
```powershell
vcpkg install openssl --triplet x32-windows
$env:OPENSSL_ROOT = "path\x32-windows"
```

- Using [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) and bash:
```bash
vcpkg.exe install openssl --triplet x32-windows
export OPENSSL_ROOT=path/x32-windows
```

### Mac OS
Using [brew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew):
```bash
brew install openssl
export OPENSSL_ROOT=$(brew --prefix openssl)
# install bjam tool user specific configuration file to read OPENSSL_ROOT
# see https://www.bfgroup.xyz/b2/manual/release/index.html
cp ./libs/beast/tools/user-config.jam $HOME
```

Make sure the bjam tool (also called "b2") is available in the path
your shell uses to find executables. The Beast project is located in
"libs/beast" relative to the directory containing the Boot superproject.
To build the Beast tests, examples, and documentation use these commands:
```
export PATH=$PWD:$PATH
b2 -j2 libs/beast/test cxxstd=11      # bjam must be in your $PATH
b2 -j2 libs/beast/example cxxstd=11   # "-j2" means use two processors
b2 libs/beast/doc                     # Doxygen and Saxon are required for this
```



Additional instructions for configuring, using, and building libraries
in superproject may be found in the
[Boost Wiki](https://github.com/boostorg/boost/wiki/Getting-Started).

## Visual Studio

CMake may be used to generate a very nice Visual Studio solution and
a set of Visual Studio project files using these commands:

```
cd libs/beast
mkdir bin
cd bin
cmake ..                                    # for 32-bit Windows builds, or
cmake -G"Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" ..    # for 64-bit Windows builds (VS2017)
```

The files in the repository are laid out thusly:

```
./
    bin/            Create this to hold executables and project files
    bin64/          Create this to hold 64-bit Windows executables and project files
    doc/            Source code and scripts for the documentation
    include/        Where the header files are located
    example/        Self contained example programs
    meta/           Metadata for Boost integration
    test/           The unit tests for Beast
    tools/          Scripts used for CI testing
```

## Usage

These examples are complete, self-contained programs that you can build
and run yourself (they are in the `example` directory).

asking them in the code review or in issues provides valuable information
that can be used to improve the library - do not hesitate, no question
is insignificant or unimportant!
