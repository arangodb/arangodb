[section Include]

Spirit is a header file only library. There are no libraries to link to.
To use Spirit X3 simply include:

    #include <boost/spirit/home/x3.hpp>

To distinguish between Spirit versions, you can inspect the version file:

    #include <boost/spirit/home/x3/version.hpp>

using the preprocessor define

    SPIRIT_X3_VERSION

It is a hex number where the first two digits determine the major version while
the last two digits determine the minor version. For example:

    #define SPIRIT_X3_VERSION 0x3010 // version 3.10
