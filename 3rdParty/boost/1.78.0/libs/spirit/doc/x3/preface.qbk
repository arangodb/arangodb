[section Preface]

[:['["Examples of designs that meet most of the criteria for
"goodness" (easy to understand, flexible, efficient) are a
recursive-descent parser, which is traditional procedural
code. Another example is the STL, which is a generic library of
containers and algorithms depending crucially on both traditional
procedural code and on parametric polymorphism.]] [*--Bjarne
Stroustrup]]

[heading How to use this manual]

This document is roughly divided into 3 parts:

# Tutorials: A step by step guide with heavily annotated code. These
  are meant to get the user acquainted with the library as quickly as
  possible. The objective is to build the confidence of the user in
  using the library through abundant examples and detailed
  instructions. Examples speak volumes and we have volumes of
  examples!

# Abstracts: A high level summary of key topics. The objective is to
  give the user a high level view of the library, the key concepts,
  background and theories.

# Reference: Detailed formal technical reference. We start with a quick
  reference -- an easy to use table that maps into the reference proper.
  The reference proper starts with C++ concepts followed by
  models of the concepts.

Some icons are used to mark certain topics indicative of their relevance.
These icons precede some text to indicate:

[table Icons

    [[Icon]             [Name]          [Meaning]]

    [[__note__]         [Note]          [Generally useful information (an aside that
                                        doesn't fit in the flow of the text)]]

    [[__tip__]          [Tip]           [Suggestion on how to do something
                                        (especially something that is not obvious)]]

    [[__important__]    [Important]     [Important note on something to take

    [[__caution__]      [Caution]       [Take special care with this - it may
                                        not be what you expect and may cause bad
                                        results]]

    [[__danger__]       [Danger]        [This is likely to cause serious
