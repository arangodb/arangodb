[section:vmd_compilers Compilers]

Tested compilers are:

On Windows:
gcc versions 4.8 through 10.2.
VC++ versions 8.0 through 14.2.
clang targeting gcc versions 3.7 through 10.0
clang targeting VC++ versions 3.9 through 10.0

In Linux:
gcc versions 4.4 through 10.2
clang versions 3.3 through 10.0
Intel C++ 12.1 throguh 19.1

Not all versions compile all tests successfully.

For VC++ 8.0 the BOOST_VMD_IS_EMPTY and BOOST_VMD_ASSERT_IS_EMPTY macros
take a single parameter rather than variadic data because this 
version of VC++ does not accept variadic data which may be empty.

The compilers supported are those which are compiled in C99/C++11 mode on up
or those compilers which, when compiled in C++98/C++03 mode, support both variadic macros and passing empty preprocessor data.
