[section:vmd_internal_macro Controlling internal usage]

The macro BOOST_VMD_ASSERT_DATA controls whether or not an assert macro
will check its data. The default is that in compiler debug mode it will check the 
data while in compiler release mode it will not check its data. The end-user can
change this by setting the macro to 0 to not check the data, or non-zero to check
the data, before including a VMD header file, or check the value if necessary after
including a VMD header file.
