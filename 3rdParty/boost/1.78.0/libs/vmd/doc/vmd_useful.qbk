[section:vmd_useful Useful variadic macros not in Boost PP]

Previous sections of this documentation have explained how VMD
can be used to parse VMD data types, as well as recognize emptiness.

Another area of functionality of VMD involves useful variadic macros, based
on the previous functionality, which expands on similar macros
already in Boost PP. These variadic macros can be divided into sections 
illustrating these areas of behavior:

# Expanded assertion macros
# Expanded identity functionality
# Expanded seq and tuple functionality for "empty" seqs and tuples

Sub-sections for each of these now follow in the documentation.
     
[include vmd_assert.qbk]
[include vmd_identity.qbk]
[include vmd_empty_ppdata.qbk]
