[section:vmd_specific_generic Macros for working with data types]

VMD macros for working with data types which VMD understands can
be divided into specific and generic macros.

The specific macros ask whether some input data is a particular
data type. The generic macros work with input data as any data
type while also allowing the programmer to separately query the type
of data.

Both specific and generic macros have their place and the macro
programmer can decide which to use for any given situation.
