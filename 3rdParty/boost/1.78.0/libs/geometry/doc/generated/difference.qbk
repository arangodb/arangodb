[heading Description]
Calculate the difference of two geometries

The free function difference calculates the spatial set theoretic difference of two geometries. 

[heading Synopsis]
``template<typename Geometry1, typename Geometry2, typename Collection, typename Strategy>
void difference(Geometry1 const & geometry1, Geometry2 const & geometry2, Collection & output_collection,
                Strategy const & strategy)``

[heading Parameters]

[table
[[Type] [Concept] [Name] [Description] ]
[[Geometry1 const &] [Any type fulfilling a Geometry Concept ] [geometry1] [A model of the specified concept ]]
[[Geometry2 const &] [Any type fulfilling a Geometry Concept ] [geometry2] [A model of the specified concept ]]
[[Collection &] [output collection, either a multi-geometry, or a std::vector<Geometry> / std::deque<Geometry> etc ] [output_collection] [the output collection ]]
[[Strategy const &] [Any type fulfilling a Difference Strategy Concept ] [strategy] [The strategy which will be used for difference calculations]]
