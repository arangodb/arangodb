[section:relation_3_with_strategy relation (with strategy)]

'''<indexterm><primary>relation</primary></indexterm>'''
Calculates the relation between a pair of geometries as defined in DE-9IM. 

[heading Synopsis]
``template<typename Geometry1, typename Geometry2, typename Strategy>
de9im::matrix relation(Geometry1 const & geometry1, Geometry2 const & geometry2, Strategy const & strategy)``

[heading Parameters]

[table
[[Type] [Concept] [Name] [Description] ]
[[Geometry1 const &] [Any type fulfilling a Geometry Concept ] [geometry1] [A model of the specified concept ]]
[[Geometry2 const &] [Any type fulfilling a Geometry Concept ] [geometry2] [A model of the specified concept ]]
[[Strategy const &] [Any type fulfilling a Relation Strategy Concept ] [strategy] [The strategy which will be used for relation calculations ]]
]


[heading Returns]
The DE-9IM matrix expressing the relation between geometries.

[heading Header]
