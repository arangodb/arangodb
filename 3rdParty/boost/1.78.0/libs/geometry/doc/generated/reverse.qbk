'''<indexterm><primary>reverse</primary></indexterm>'''
Reverses the points within a geometry. 

[heading Description]
Generic function to reverse a geometry. It resembles the std::reverse functionality, but it takes the geometry type into account. Only for a ring or for a linestring it is the same as the std::reverse.

[heading Synopsis]
``template<typename Geometry>
void reverse(Geometry & geometry)``

[heading Parameters]

[table
[[Type] [Concept] [Name] [Description] ]
[[Geometry &] [Any type fulfilling a Geometry Concept ] [geometry] [A model of the specified concept which will be reversed]]
]
