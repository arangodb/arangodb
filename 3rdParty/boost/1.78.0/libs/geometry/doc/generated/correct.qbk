[section:correct_1 correct]

'''<indexterm><primary>correct</primary></indexterm>'''
Corrects a geometry. 

[heading Description]
Corrects a geometry: all rings which are wrongly oriented with respect to their expected orientation are reversed. To all rings which do not have a closing point and are typed as they should have one, the first point is appended. Also boxes can be corrected.

[heading Synopsis]
``template<typename Geometry>
void correct(Geometry & geometry)``

[heading Parameters]

[table
[[Type] [Concept] [Name] [Description] ]
[[Geometry &] [Any type fulfilling a Geometry Concept ] [geometry] [A model of the specified concept which will be corrected if necessary]]
]


[heading Header]
Either

`#include <boost/geometry.hpp>`


Or

`#include <boost/geometry/algorithms/correct.hpp>`

[include reference/algorithms/correct.qbk]
