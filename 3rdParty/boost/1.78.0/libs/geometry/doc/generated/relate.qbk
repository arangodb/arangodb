[section:relate_4_with_strategy relate (with strategy)]

'''<indexterm><primary>relate</primary></indexterm>'''
Checks relation between a pair of geometries defined by a mask. 

[heading Synopsis]
``template<typename Geometry1, typename Geometry2, typename Mask, typename Strategy>
bool relate(Geometry1 const & geometry1, Geometry2 const & geometry2, Mask const & mask,
            Strategy const & strategy)``

[heading Parameters]

[table
[[Type] [Concept] [Name] [Description] ]
[[Geometry1 const &] [Any type fulfilling a Geometry Concept ] [geometry1] [A model of the specified concept ]]
[[Geometry2 const &] [Any type fulfilling a Geometry Concept ] [geometry2] [A model of the specified concept ]]
[[Mask const &] [An intersection model Mask type. ] [mask] [An intersection model mask object. ]]
[[Strategy const &] [Any type fulfilling a Relate Strategy Concept ] [strategy] [The strategy which will be used for relate calculations ]]
]


[heading Returns]
true if the relation is compatible with the mask, false otherwise.

[heading Header]
Either

`#include <boost/geometry.hpp>`


Or

`#include <boost/geometry/algorithms/relate.hpp>`

[include reference/algorithms/relate.qbk]
