'''<indexterm><primary>clear</primary></indexterm>'''
Clears a linestring, ring or polygon (exterior+interiors) or multi*. 

[heading Description]
Generic function to clear a geometry. All points will be removed from the collection or collections making up the geometry. In most cases this is equivalent to the .clear() method of a std::vector<...>. In the case of a polygon, this clear functionality is automatically called for the exterior ring, and for the interior ring collection. In the case of a point, boxes and segments, nothing will happen.

[heading Synopsis]
``template<typename Geometry>
void clear(Geometry & geometry)``
