[heading Conformance]
Other libraries refer to this functionality as [*ST_GeomFromText] or [*STGeomFromText].
That is not done here because Boost.Geometry support more text formats. The name GeomFromText
is reserved for future usage, which will then have an indication of the used text format.


[heading Example]
[read_wkt]
