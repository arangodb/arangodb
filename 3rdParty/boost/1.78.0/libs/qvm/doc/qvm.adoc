[abstract]
== Abstract
QVM is a generic library for working with Quaternions, Vectors and Matrices of static size. Features:

====
* Emphasis on 2, 3 and 4-dimensional operations needed in graphics, video games and simulation applications.
* Free function templates operate on any compatible user-defined Quaternion, Vector or Matrix type.
* Enables Quaternion, Vector and Matrix types from different libraries to be safely mixed in the same expression.
* Type-safe mapping between compatible lvalue types with no temporary objects; f.ex. transpose remaps the access to the elements, rather than transforming the matrix.
* Requires only {CPP}03.
* Zero dependencies.

== Tutorial

=== Quaternions, Vectors, Matrices

Out of the box QVM defines generic yet simple <<quat,`quat`>>, <<vec,`vec`>> and <<mat,`mat`>> types. For example, the following snippet creates a quaternion object that rotates around the X axis:

[source,c++]
----
quat<float> rx = rotx_quat(3.14159f);
----

Similarly, a matrix that translates by a given vector can be created as follows:

[source,c++]
----
vec<float,3> v = {0,0,7};
mat<float,4,4> tr = translation_mat(v);
----

The usual quaternion, vector and matrix operations work on these QVM types, however the operations are decoupled from any specific type: they work on any suitable type that has been registered by specializing the <<quat_traits,`quat_traits`>>, <<vec_traits,`vec_traits`>> and <<mat_traits,`mat_traits`>> templates.

For example, a user-defined 3D vector type `float3` can be introduced to QVM as follows:

[source,c++]
----
struct float3 { float a[3]; };

namespace boost { namespace qvm {

  template <>
  struct vec_traits<float3> {

    static int const dim=3;
    typedef float scalar_type;

    template <int I>
    static inline scalar_type & write_element( float3 & v ) {
      return v.a[I];
    }

    template <int I>
    static inline scalar_type read_element( float3 const & v ) {
      return v.a[I];
    }

    static inline scalar_type & write_element_idx( int i, float3 & v ) {
      return v.a[i];
    } //optional

    static inline scalar_type read_element_idx( int i, float3 const & v ) {
      return v.a[i];
    } //optional

  };

} }
----

Equivalently, using the <<vec_traits_defaults,`vec_traits_defaults`>> template the above can be shortened to:

[source,c++]
----
namespace boost { namespace qvm {

  template <>
  struct vec_traits<float3>: vec_traits_defaults<float3,float,3> {

    template <int I>
    static inline scalar_type & write_element( float3 & v ) {
      return v.a[I];
    }

    static inline scalar_type & write_element_idx( int i, float3 & v ) {
      return v.a[i];
    } //optional

  };

} }
----

After a similar specialization of the <<mat_traits,`mat_traits`>> template for a user-defined 3x3 matrix type `float33`, the full range of vector and matrix operations defined by QVM headers becomes available automatically:

[source,c++]
----
float3 v;
X(v) = 0;
Y(v) = 0;
Z(v) = 7;
float vmag = mag(v);
float33 m = rotx_mat<3>(3.14159f);
float3 vrot = m * v;
----

User-defined quaternion types are similarly introduced to QVM by specializing the <<quat_traits,`quat_traits`>> template.

'''

=== C Arrays

In `boost/qvm/quat_traits_array.hpp`, `vec_traits_array.hpp` and `mat_traits_array.hpp`, QVM defines appropriate <<quat_traits,`quat_traits`>>, <<vec_traits,`vec_traits`>> and <<mat_traits,`mat_traits`>> specializations that allow QVM functions to operate directly on plain old C arrays:

[source,c++]
----
float v[3] = {0,0,7};
float3 vrot = rotx_mat<3>(3.14159f) * v;
----

Naturally, operator overloads cannot kick in if all elements of an expression are of built-in types. The following is still illegal:

[source,c++]
----
float v[3] = {0,0,7};
v *= 42;
----

The <<vref,`vref`>> and <<mref,`mref`>> function templates can be used to work around this issue:

[source,c++]
----
float v[3] = {0,0,7};
vref(v) *= 42;
----

'''

[[view_proxy]]
=== View proxies

QVM defines various function templates that provide static mapping between (possibly user-defined) quaternion, vector and matrix types. The example below multiplies column 1 (QVM indexes are always zero-based) of the matrix `m` by a scalar:

[source,c++]
----
void multiply_column1( float33 & m, float scalar ) {
  col<1>(m) *= scalar;
}
----

The expression <<col,`col<1>(m)`>> is an lvalue of an unspecified 3D vector type that refers to column 1 of `m`. Note however that this does not create any temporary objects; instead `operator*=` above works directly with a reference to `m`.

Here is another example, multiplying a transposed view of a matrix by a vector of some user-defined type `float3`:

[source,c++]
----
float3 v = {0,0,7};
float3 vrot = transposed(rotx_mat<3>(3.14159f)) * v;
----

In general, the various view proxy functions return references of unspecified, non-copyable types that refer to the original object. They can be assigned from or converted to any compatible vector or matrix type.

'''

=== Swizzling

QVM allows accessing vector elements by swizzling, exposing vector views of different dimensions, and/or views with reordered elements. The example below rotates `v` around the X axis, and stores the resulting vector back in `v` but with the X and Y elements swapped:

[source,c++]
----
float3 v = {0,0,7};
YXZ(v) = rotx_mat<3>(3.14159f) * v;
----

A special case of swizzling provides next-dimension-view of a vector object, adding either 0 or 1 as its last component. Assuming `float3` is a 3D vector type, and `float4` is a 4D vector type, the following statements are valid:

[source,c++]
----
float3 v = {0,0,7};
float4 point = XYZ1(v); //{0,0,7,1}
float4 vector = XYZ0(v); //{0,0,7,0}
----

It is also valid for swizzling to address vector elements more than once:

[source,c++]
----
float3 v = {0,0,7};
float4 v1 = ZZZZ(v); //{7,7,7,7}
----

QVM defines all permutations of `X`, `Y`, `Z`, `W` for 1D, 2D, 3D and 4D swizzling, plus each dimension defines variants with 0 or 1 used at any position (if 0 or 1 appear at the first position, the swizzling function name begins with underscore, e.g. `_1XY`).

The swizzling syntax can also be used to bind scalars as vectors. For example:

[source,c++]
----
float3 v = _00X(42.0f); //{0,0,42}
----

'''

[[enable_if]]
=== SFINAE/enable_if

SFINAE stands for Substitution Failure Is Not An Error. This refers to a situation in {CPP} where an invalid substitution of template parameters (including when those parameters are deduced implicitly as a result of an unqualified call) is not in itself an error.

In absence of concepts support, SFINAE can be used to disable function template overloads that would otherwise present a signature that is too generic. More formally, this is supported by the Boost `enable_if` library.

For example, QVM defines `operator*` overload which works with any user-defined matrix and vector types. The naive approach would be to declare this overload as follows:

[source,c++]
----
template <class Matrix,class Vector>
Vector operator*( Matrix const & m, Vector const & v );
----

Even if the function definition might contain code that would compile only for `Matrix` and `Vector` types, because the function declaration itself is valid, it will participate in overload rezolutions when multiplying objects of any two types whatsoever. This typically renders overload resolutions ambiguous and the compiler (correctly) issues an error.

Using `enable_if`, QVM declares such overloads in a way that preserves their generic signature but only participate in overload resolutions if the passed parameters make sense depending on the semantics of the operation being defined:

[source,c++]
----
template <class A,class B>
typename enable_if_c<
  is_mat<A>::value && is_vec<B>::value && mat_traits<A>::cols==vec_traits<B>::dim, //Condition
  B>::type //Return type
operator*( A const & a, B const & b );
----

For brevity, function declarations throughout this documentation specify the condition which controls whether they are enabled or not without specifying exactly what `enable_if` construct is used to achieve this effect.

'''

=== Interoperability

An important design goal of QVM is that it works seamlessly with 3rd-party quaternion, vector and matrix types and libraries. Even when such libraries overload the same {CPP} operators as QVM, it is safe to bring the entire `boost::qvm` namespace in scope by specifying:

[source,c++]
----
using namespace boost::qvm;
----

The above using directive does not introduce ambiguities with function and operator overloads defined by a 3rd-party library because:

- Most `boost::qvm` function overloads and all operator overloads use SFINAE/`enable_if`, which makes them "disappear" unless an expression uses types that have the appropriate QVM-specific type traits defined;

- Whenever such overloads are compatible with a given expression, their signature is extremely generic, which means that any other (user-defined) compatible overload will be a better match in any overload resolution.

NOTE: Bringing the entire boost::qvm namespace in scope may introduce ambiguities when accessing types (as opposed to functions) defined by 3rd-party libraries. In that case, you can safely bring namespace `boost::qvm::sfinae` in scope instead, which contains only function and operator overloads that use SFINAE/`enable_if`.

==== Specifying return types for binary operations

Bringing the `boost::qvm` namespace in scope lets you mix vector and matrix types that come from different APIs into a common, type-safe framework. In this case however, it should be considered what types should be returned by binary operations that return an object by value. For example, if you multiply a 3x3 matrix `m1` of type `user_matrix1` by a 3x3 matrix `m2` of type `user_matrix2`, what type should that operation return?

The answer is that by default, QVM returns some kind of compatible matrix type, so it is always safe to write:

[source,c++]
----
auto & m = m1 * m2; // auto requires C++11
----

However, the type deduced by default converts implicitly to any compatible matrix type, so the following is also valid, at the cost of a temporary:

[source,c++]
----
user_matrix1 m = m1 * m2;
----

While the temporary object can be optimized away by many compilers, it can be avoided altogether by specializing the <<deduce_mat2,`deduce_mat2`>> template. For example, to specify that multiplying a `user_matrix1` by a `user_matrix2` should always produce a `user_matrix1` object, you could write:

[source,c++]
----
namespace boost { namespace qvm {

  template <>
  struct deduce_mat2<user_matrix1,user_matrix2,3,3> {
    typedef user_matrix1 type;
  };

  template <>
  struct deduce_mat2<user_matrix2,user_matrix1,3,3> {
    typedef user_matrix1 type;
  };

} }
----

[WARNING]
====
Be mindful of potential ODR violation when using <<deduce_quat2,`deduce_quat2`>>, <<deduce_vec2,`deduce_vec2`>> and <<deduce_mat2,`deduce_mat2`>> in independent libraries. For example, this could happen if `lib1` defines `deduce_vec2<lib1::vec,lib2::vec>::type` as `lib1::vec` and in the same program `lib2` defines `deduce_vec2<lib1::vec,lib2::vec>::type` as `lib2::vec`.

It is best to keep such specializations out of `lib1` and `lib2`. Of course, it is always safe for `lib1` and `lib2` to use <<convert_to,`convert_to`>> to convert between the `lib1::vec` and `lib2::vec` types as needed.
====

==== Specifying return types for unary operations

Perhaps surprisingly, unary operations that return an object by value have a similar, though simpler issue. That's because the argument they're called with may not be copyable, as in:

[source,c++]
----
float m[3][3];
auto & inv = inverse(m);
----

Above, the object returned by <<mat_inverse,`inverse`>> and captured by `inv` can not be of type `float[3][3]`, because that type isn't copyable. By default, QVM "just works", returning an object of suitable matrix type that is copyable. This deduction process can be controlled, by specializing the <<deduce_mat,`deduce_mat`>> template.

==== Converting between different quaternion, vector and matrix types

Any time you need to create a matrix of a particular {CPP} type from any other compatible matrix type, you can use the <<convert_to,`convert_to`>> function:

[source,c++]
----
user_matrix2 m=convert_to<user_matrix2>(m1 * m2);
----

=== Header Files

QVM is split into multiple headers to allow different compilation units to `#include` only the components they need. Each function in this document specifies the exact header that must be `#included` in order to use it.

The tables below list commonly used components and the headers they're found in. Header names containing a number define functions that only work with objects of that dimension; e.g. `vec_operations2.hpp` contains only functions for working with 2D vectors.

The header `boost/qvm/all.hpp` is provided for convenience. It includes all other QVM headers.

In addition, Boost QVM is available in single-header format for maximum portability. See <<Distribution>>.

[[type_traits]]
=== Type Traits System

QVM is designed to work with user-defined quaternion, vector and matrix types, as well as user-defined scalar types. This section formally defines the way such types can be integrated.

'''

[[scalar_requirements]]
==== Scalar Requirements

A valid scalar type `S` must have accessible destructor, default constructor, copy constructor and assignment operator, and must support the following operations:

[source,c++]
----
S operator*( S, S );
S operator/( S, S );
S operator+( S, S );
S operator-( S, S );

S & operator*=( S &, S );
S & operator/=( S &, S );
S & operator+=( S &, S );
S & operator-=( S &, S );

bool operator==( S, S );
bool operator!=( S, S );
----

In addition, the expression `S(0)` should construct a scalar of value zero, and `S(1)` should construct a scalar of value one, or else the <<scalar_traits,`scalar_traits`>> template must be specialized appropriately.

'''

[[is_scalar]]
==== `is_scalar`

.#include <boost/qvm/scalar_traits.hpp>
[source,c++]
----
namespace boost { namespace qvm {

  template <class T>
  struct is_scalar {
    static bool const value=false;
  };

  template <> struct is_scalar<char>           { static bool const value=true; };
  template <> struct is_scalar<signed char>    { static bool const value=true; };
  template <> struct is_scalar<unsigned char>  { static bool const value=true; };
  template <> struct is_scalar<signed short>   { static bool const value=true; };
  template <> struct is_scalar<unsigned short> { static bool const value=true; };
  template <> struct is_scalar<signed int>     { static bool const value=true; };
  template <> struct is_scalar<unsigned int>   { static bool const value=true; };
  template <> struct is_scalar<signed long>    { static bool const value=true; };
  template <> struct is_scalar<unsigned long>  { static bool const value=true; };
  template <> struct is_scalar<float>          { static bool const value=true; };
  template <> struct is_scalar<double>         { static bool const value=true; };
  template <> struct is_scalar<long double>    { static bool const value=true; };

} }
----

This template defines a compile-time boolean constant value which can be used to determine whether a type `T` is a valid scalar type. It must be specialized together with the <<scalar_traits,`scalar_traits`>> template in order to introduce a user-defined scalar type to QVM. Such types must satisfy the <<scalar_requirements,scalar requirements>>.

'''

[[scalar_traits]]
==== `scalar_traits`

.#include <boost/qvm/scalar_traits.hpp>

----
namespace boost { namespace qvm {

  struct scalar_traits {

    BOOST_QVM_INLINE_CRITICAL
    static Scalar value( int v ) {
      return Scalar(v);
    }

  };

} }
----

This template may be specialized for user-defined scalar types to define the appropriate conversion from `int`; this is primarily used whenever QVM needs to deduce a zero or one value.

'''

[[deduce_scalar]]
==== `deduce_scalar`

.#include <boost/qvm/deduce_scalar.hpp>
[source,c++]
----
namespace boost { namespace qvm {

  template <class A,class B>
  struct deduce_scalar
  {
    typedef typename /*exact definition unspecified*/ type;
  };

} }
----

Requires: :: `A` and `B` satisfy the <<scalar_requirements,scalar requirements>>.

Returns: ::

If `A` and `B` are the same type, `scalar_traits<A,B>::type` is defined as that type. Otherwise for the following types:

* `signed`/`unsigned char`,
* `signed`/`unsigned short`,
* `signed`/`unsigned int`,
* `signed`/`unsigned long`,
* `float`,
* `double`,

the deduction logic is as follows:

- if either of `A` and `B` is `double`, the result is `double`;
- else, if one of `A` or `B` is an integer type and the other is `float`, the result is `float`;
- else, if one of `A` or `B` is a signed integer and the other type is unsigned integer, the signed type is changed to unsigned, and then the lesser of the two integers is promoted to the other.

For any other types `scalar_traits<A,B>::type` is defined as `void`. It can be specialized for user-defined scalar types.

NOTE: This template is used by generic binary operations that return a scalar, to deduce the return type based on the (possibly different) scalars of their arguments.

'''

[[scalar]]
==== `scalar`

.#include <boost/qvm/scalar_traits.hpp>
[source,c++]
----
namespace boost { namespace qvm {

  template <class T>
  struct scalar {
    typedef /*exact definition unspecified*/ type;
  };

} }
----

The expression <<quat_traits,`quat_traits<T>::scalar_type`>> evaluates to the scalar type of the quaternion type `T` (if <<is_quat,`is_quat<T>::value`>> is `true`).

The expression <<vec_traits,`vec_traits<T>::scalar_type`>> evaluates to the scalar type of the vector type `T` (if <<is_vec,`is_vec<T>::value`>> is `true`).

The expression <<mat_traits,`mat_traits<T>::scalar_type`>> evaluates to the scalar type of the matrix type `T` (if <<is_mat,`is_mat<T>::value`>> is `true`).

The expression `scalar<T>::type` is similar, except that it automatically detects whether `T` is a vector or a matrix or a quaternion type.

'''

[[is_quat]]

[source,c++]
----
namespace boost { namespace qvm {

  template <class T>
  struct is_quat {

    static bool const value = false;

  };

} }
----

This type template defines a compile-time boolean constant value which can be used to determine whether a type `T` is a quaternion type. For quaternion types, the <<quat_traits,`quat_traits`>> template can be used to access their elements generically, or to obtain their `scalar type`.

'''

[[quat_traits]]
==== `quat_traits`

.#include <boost/qvm/quat_traits.hpp>
[source,c++]
----
namespace boost { namespace qvm {

  template <class Q>
  struct quat_traits {

    /*main template members unspecified*/

  /*
  User-defined (possibly partial) specializations:

    template <int I>
    static inline scalar_type & write_element( Quaternion & q );

  };
  */

} }
----

The `quat_traits` template must be specialized for (user-defined) quaternion types in order to enable quaternion operations defined in QVM headers for objects of those types.

NOTE: QVM quaternion operations do not require that quaternion types are copyable.

The main `quat_traits` template members are not specified. Valid specializations are required to define the following members:

- `scalar_type`: the expression `quat_traits<Quaternion>::scalar_type` must be a value type which satisfies the <<scalar_requirements,`scalar requirements`>>.

In addition, valid specializations of the `quat_traits` template must define at least one of the following access functions as static members, where `q` is an object of type `Quaternion`, and `I` is compile-time integer constant:

- `read_element`: the expression `quat_traits<Quaternion>::read_element<I>(q)` returns either a copy of or a `const` reference to the `I`-th element of `q`.

- `write_element`: the expression `quat_traits<Quaternion>::write_element<I>(q)` returns mutable reference to the `I`-th element of `q`.

NOTE: For the quaternion `a + bi + cj + dk`, the elements are assumed to be in the following order: `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`; that is, `I`=`0`/`1`/`2`/`3` would access `a`/`b`/`c`/`d`.

It is illegal to call any of the above functions unless `is_quat<Quaternion>::value` is true. Even then, quaternion types are allowed to define only a subset of the access functions.

Below is an example of a user-defined quaternion type, and its corresponding specialization of the quat_traits template:

[source,c++]
----
#include <boost/qvm/quat_traits.hpp>

struct fquat { float a[4]; };

namespace boost { namespace qvm {

  template <>
  struct quat_traits<fquat> {

    typedef float scalar_type;

    template <int I>
    static inline scalar_type & write_element( fquat & q ) {
      return q.a[I];
    }

    template <int I>
    static inline scalar_type read_element( fquat const & q ) {
      return q.a[I];
    }

  };

} }
----

Equivalently, using the <<quat_traits_defaults,`quat_traits_defaults`>> template the above can be shortened to:

[source,c++]
----
namespace boost { namespace qvm {

  template <>
  struct quat_traits<fquat>: quat_traits_defaults<fquat,float> {

----

The `vec_traits` template must be specialized for (user-defined) vector types in order to enable vector and matrix operations defined in QVM headers for objects of those types.

NOTE: QVM vector operations do not require that vector types are copyable.

The main `vec_traits` template members are not specified. Valid specializations are required to define the following members:

- `dim`: the expression `vec_traits<Vector>::dim` must evaluate to a compile-time integer constant greater than 0 that specifies the vector size.

- `scalar_type`: the expression `vec_traits<Vector>::scalar_type` must be a value type which satisfies the <<scalar_requirements,`scalar requirements`>>.

In addition, valid specializations of the `vec_traits` template may define the following access functions as static members, where `v` is an object of type `Vector`, `I` is a compile-time integer constant, and `i` is a variable of type `int`:

- `read_element`: the expression `vec_traits<Vector>::read_element<I>(v)` returns either a copy of or a const reference to the `I`-th element of `v`.

- `write_element`: the expression `vec_traits<Vector>::write_element<I>(v)` returns mutable reference to the `I`-th element of `v`.

- `read_element_idx`: the expression `vec_traits<Vector>::read_element_idx(i,v)` returns either a copy of or a `const` reference to the `i`-th element of `v`.

- `write_element_idx`: the expression `vec_traits<Vector>::write_element_idx(i,v)` returns mutable reference to the `i`-th element of `v`.

It is illegal to call any of the above functions unless `is_vec<Vector>::value` is true. Even then, vector types are allowed to define only a subset of the access functions. The general requirements are:

- At least one of `read_element` or `write_element` must be defined;
- If `read_element_idx` is defined, `read_element` must also be defined;
- If `write_element_idx` is defined, `write_element` must also be defined.

Below is an example of a user-defined 3D vector type, and its corresponding specialization of the `vec_traits` template:

[source,c++]

#include <boost/qvm/vec_traits.hpp>

struct float3 { float a[3]; };

    static inline scalar_type read_element_idx( int i, float3 const & v ) {

An expression of the form `S(q)` can be used to access the scalar component of the quaternion `q`. For example,

----
S(q) *= 42;

An expression of the form `V(q)` can be used to access the vector component of the quaternion `q`. For example,

[source,c++]
----
V(q) *= 42

multiplies the vector component of `q` by the scalar 42.

The `X`, `Y` and `Z` elements of the vector component can also be accessed directly using `X(q)`, `Y(q)` and `Z(q)`.

Swizzling allows zero-overhead direct access to a (possibly rearranged) subset of the elements of 2D, 3D and 4D vectors. For example, if `v` is a 4D vector, the expression `YX(v) is a 2D view proxy whose `X` element refers to the `Y` element of `v`, and whose `Y` element refers to the `X` element of `v`. Like other view proxies `YX` is an lvalue, that is, if `v2` is a 2D vector, one could write:

[source,c++]
----
YX(v) = v2;
----

The above will leave the `Z` and `W` elements of `v` unchanged but assign the `Y` element of `v2` to the `X` element of `v` and the `X` element of `v2` to the `Y` element of `v`.

All permutations of `X`, `Y`, `Z`, `W`, `0`, `1` for 2D, 3D and 4D swizzling are available (if the first character of the swizzle identifier is `0` or `1`, it is preceded by a `_`, for example `_11XY`).

It is valid to use the same vector element more than once: the expression `ZZZ(v)` is a 3D vector whose `X`, `Y` and `Z` elements all refer to the `Z` element of `v`.

Finally, scalars can be "swizzled" to access them as vectors: the expression `_0X01(42.0f)` is a 4D vector with `X`=0, `Y`=42.0, `Z`=0, `W`=1.

----

can be used to multiply the element at row 4 and column 2 of a matrix `m` by 42.

For convenience, there are also non-template overloads for `R` from `0` to `9` and `C` from `0` to `9`; an alternative way to write the above expression is:

[[rationale]]
== Design Rationale

{CPP} is ideal for 3D graphics and other domains that require 3D transformations: define vector and matrix types and then overload the appropriate operators to implement the standard algebraic operations. Because this is relatively straight-forward, there are many libraries that do this, each providing custom vector and matrix types, and then defining the same operations (e.g. matrix multiply) for these types.

Often these libraries are part of a higher level system. For example, video game programmers typically use one set of vector/matrix types with the rendering engine, and another with the physics simulation engine.

QVM proides interoperability between all these different types and APIs by decoupling the standard algebraic functions from the types they operate on -- without compromising type safety. The operations work on any type for which proper traits have been specialized. Using QVM, there is no need to translate between the different quaternion, vector or matrix types; they can be mixed in the same expression safely and efficiently.

This design enables QVM to generate types and adaptors at compile time, compatible with any other QVM or user-defined type. For example, transposing a matrix needs not store the result: rather than modifying its argument or returning a new object, it simply binds the original matrix object through a generated type which remaps element access on the fly.

In addition, QVM can be helpful in selectively optimizing individual types or operations for maximum performance where that matters. For example, users can overload a specific operation for specific types, or define highly optimized, possibly platform-specific or for some reason cumbersome to use types, then mix and match them with more user-friendly types in parts of the program where performance isn't critical.

== Code Generator

While QVM defines generic functions that operate on matrix and vector types of arbitrary static dimensions, it also provides a code generator that can be used to create compatible header files that define much simpler specializations of these functions for specific dimensions. This is useful during debugging since the generated code is much easier to read than the template metaprogramming-heavy generic implementations. It is also potentially friendlier to the optimizer.

The code generator is a command-line utility program. Its source code can be found in the `boost/libs/qvm/gen` directory. It was used to generate the following headers that ship with QVM:

* 2D, 3D and 4D matrix operations:
** `boost/qvm/gen/mat_operations2.hpp` (matrices of size 2x2, 2x1 and 1x2, included by `boost/qvm/mat_operations2.hpp`)
** `boost/qvm/gen/mat_operations3.hpp` (matrices of size 3x3, 3x1 and 1x3, included by `boost/qvm/mat_operations3.hpp`)
** `boost/qvm/gen/mat_operations4.hpp` (matrices of size 4x4, 4x1 and 1x4, included by `boost/qvm/mat_operations4.hpp`)
* 2D, 3D and 4D vector operations:
** `boost/qvm/gen/v2.hpp` (included by `boost/qvm/vec_operations2.hpp`)

Any such generated headers must be included before the corresponding generic header file is included. For example, if one creates a header `boost/qvm/gen/m5.hpp`, it must be included before `boost/qvm/mat_operations.hpp` in included. However, the generic headers (`boost/qvm/mat_operations.hpp`, `boost/qvm/vec_operations.hpp`, `boost/qvm/vec_mat_operations.hpp` and `boost/qvm/swizzle.hpp`) already include the generated headers from the list above, so the generated headers don't need to be included manually.

NOTE: headers under `boost/qvm/gen` are not part of the public interface of QVM. For example, `boost/qvm/gen/mat_operations2.hpp` should not be included directly; `#include <boost/qvm/mat_operations2.hpp>` instead.

== Known Quirks and Issues

=== Capturing View Proxies with `auto`

By design, <<view_proxy,view proxies>> must not return temporary objects. They return reference to an argument they take by (`const`) reference, cast to reference of unspecified type that is not copyable. Because of this, the return value of a view proxy can not be captured by value with `auto`:

[source,c++]
----
auto tr = transposed(m); //Error: the return type of transposed can not be copied.
----

The correct use of auto with view proxies is:

[source,c++]
----
auto & tr = transposed(m);
----

NOTE: Many view proxies are not read-only, that is, they're lvalues; changes made on the view proxy operate on the original object. This is another reason why they can not be captured by value with  `auto`.

=== Binding QVM Overloads From an Unrelated Namespace

The operator overloads in namespace `boost::qvm` are designed to work with user-defined types. Typically it is sufficient to make these operators available in the namespace where the operator is used, by `using namespace boost::qvm`. A problem arises if the scope that uses the operator is not controlled by the user. For example:

[source,c++]
----
namespace ns1 {

  struct float2 { float x, y; };

}

namespace ns2 {

  using namespace boost::qvm;

  void f() {
    ns1::float2 a, b;
    a==b; //OK
    ns1::float2 arr1[2], arr2[2];
    std::equal(arr1,arr1+2,arr2); //Error: operator== is inaccessible from namespace std
  }

}
----

In the `std::equal` expression above, even though `boost::qvm::operator==` is made visible in namespace `ns2` by `using namespace boost::qvm`, the call originates from namespace `std`. In this case the compiler can't bind `boost::qvm::operator==` because only namespace `ns1` is visible through ADL, and it does not contain a suitable declaration. The solution is to declare `operator==` in namespace ns1, which can be done like this:

[source,c++]
----
namespace ns1 {

  using boost::qvm::operator==;

}
----

=== Link Errors When Calling Math Functions with `int` Arguments

QVM does not call standard math functions (e.g. sin, cos, etc.) directly. Instead, it calls function templates declared in `boost/qvm/math.hpp` in namespace `boost::qvm`. This allows the user to specialize these templates for user-defined scalar types.

QVM itself defines specializations of the math function templates only for `float` and `double`, but it does not provide generic definitions. This is done to protect the user from unintentionally writing code that binds standard math functions that take `double` when passing arguments of lesser types, which would be suboptimal.

Because of this, a call to e.g. `<<rot_mat,rot_mat>>(axis,1)` will compile successfully but fail to link, since it calls e.g. `boost::qvm::sin<int>`, which is undefined. Because rotations by integer number of radians are rarely needed, in QVM there is no protection against such errors. In such cases the solution is to use `rot_mat(axis,1.0f)` instead.

== Q&A

[qanda]
What is the motivation behind QVM? Why not just use uBLAS/Eigen/CML/GLM/etc?:: The primary domain of QVM is realtime graphics and simulation applications, so it is not a complete linear algebra library. While (naturally) there is some overlap with such libraries, QVM puts the emphasis on 2, 3 and 4 dimensional zero-overhead operations (hence domain-specific features like Swizzling).

How does the `qvm::<<vec,vec>>` (or `qvm::<<mat,mat>>`, or `qvm::<<quat,quat>>`) template compare to vector types from other libraries?:: The `qvm::vec` template is not in any way central to the vector operations defined by QVM. The operations are designed to work with any user-defined vector type or with 3rd-party vector types (e.g. `D3DVECTOR`), while the `qvm::vec` template is simply a default return type for expressions that use arguments of different types that would be incompatible outside of QVM. For example, if the <<deduce_mat2,`deduce_mat2`>> hasn't been specialized, calling <<cross,`cross`>> with a user-defined type `vec3` and a user-defined type `float3` returns a `qvm::vec`.

Why doesn't QVM use [] or () to access vector and matrix elements?:: Because it's designed to work with user-defined types, and the {CPP} standard requires these operators to be members. Of course if a user-defined type defines `operator[]` or `operator()` they are available for use with other QVM functions, but QVM defines its own mechanisms for <<quat_access,accessing quaternion elements>>, <<vec_access,accessing vector elements>> (as well as <<swizzling,swizzling>>), and <<mat_access,accessing matrix elements>>.
