[section Allocators]

Here we discuss the various allocator models used in the
C++ standard, followed by an explanation of the model used in
this library and its benefits. Finally we discuss how the library
interoperates with existing code that uses polymorphic allocators.

[note
    In the sections which follow, the aliases
    __memory_resource__ and __polymorphic_allocator__
    refer to either Boost types, or `std` types when
    `BOOST_JSON_STANDALONE` is defined.
