[section:mpl MPL Interoperability]

All the value based traits in this library conform to MPL's requirements
for an [@../../../../libs/mpl/doc/refmanual/integral-constant.html Integral Constant type].  

Please note that these types no longer inherit from `mpl::true_` or `mpl::false_` etc, and the library
will no longer implicitly include any MPL header.  However there is an implicit conversion from
`integral_constant` to the corresponding MPL types, therefore tag-dispatching that uses MPL types
in function overloads will still work as before.
