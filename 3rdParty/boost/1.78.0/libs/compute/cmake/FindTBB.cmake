# GvdB: This module uses the environment variable TBB_ARCH_PLATFORM which defines architecture and compiler.
#   e.g. "ia32/vc8" or "em64t/cc4.1.0_libc2.4_kernel2.6.16.21"
#   TBB_ARCH_PLATFORM is set by the build script `tbbvars[.bat|.sh|.csh], which can be found
#   in the TBB installation directory (TBB_INSTALL_DIR).
#
# GvdB: Mac OS X distribution places libraries directly in lib directory.
#
# For backwards compatibility, you may explicitely set the CMake variables TBB_ARCHITECTURE and TBB_COMPILER.
# TBB_ARCHITECTURE [ ia32 | em64t | itanium ]
#   which architecture to use
# TBB_COMPILER e.g. vc9 or cc3.2.3_libc2.3.2_kernel2.4.21 or cc4.0.1_os10.4.9
#   which compiler to use (detected automatically on Windows)

# This module respects
# TBB_INSTALL_DIR or $ENV{TBB21_INSTALL_DIR} or $ENV{TBB_INSTALL_DIR}

# This module defines
# TBB_INCLUDE_DIRS, where to find task_scheduler_init.h, etc.
# TBB_LIBRARY_DIRS, where to find libtbb, libtbbmalloc
# TBB_DEBUG_LIBRARY_DIRS, where to find libtbb_debug, libtbbmalloc_debug
# TBB_INSTALL_DIR, the base TBB install directory
# TBB_LIBRARIES, the libraries to link against to use TBB.
# TBB_DEBUG_LIBRARIES, the libraries to link against to use TBB with debug symbols.
# TBB_FOUND, If false, don't try to use TBB.
# TBB_INTERFACE_VERSION, as defined in tbb/tbb_stddef.h
