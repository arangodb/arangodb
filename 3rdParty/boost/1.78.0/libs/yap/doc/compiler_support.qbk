[section Compiler Support]

_yap_ is written against the C++14 and C++17 standards.  It will use C++17
features if they are present, and otherwise is C++14 code.

_yap_ also uses Boost.Hana extensively, so only compilers that support Hana
will be usable in building _yap_.

Clang versions 3.8 and later (which corresponds to XCode versions 7.3 or
later), and GCC versions 6 and later should work.

MSVC++ version 14.15 (Visual Studio 2017 version 15.8) is partially supported.
The tests all pass, but some compilation errors can be found in some of the
examples.
