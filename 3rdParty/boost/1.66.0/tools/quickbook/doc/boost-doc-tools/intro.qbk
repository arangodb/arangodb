Much of the boost documentation is generated using a collection of
documentation tools which make it easier to write documentation in the
boost style, and give a consistent look and feel. Setting up and
configuring these tools can be tricky, but once everything is in place,
it's mostly quite easy to use. There's no requirement to use any of
this, but feedback on the documentation generated with these tools
is generally positive.

The diagram below illustrates the way the various documentation tools
fit together. Note that you don't have to use all of this, and the
process is automated using Boost.Build, but having a rough
understanding of the build process will help understand the tools
better.
