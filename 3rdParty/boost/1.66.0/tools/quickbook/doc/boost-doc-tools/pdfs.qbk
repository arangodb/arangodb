To build pdf you will need an FO processor, we recommend using
[@http://www.renderx.com/download/personal.html
XEP Personal edition]. You will also need a Java virtual machine to run the FO
processor on.

You will then need to edit your [^user-config.jam] file to point to the
location of the FO processor, for example:

    using fop :
       # path to invocation batch file:
       C:/Progra~1/RenderX/xep/xep.bat
       :
       # path to Java installation, this is ignored if you're using XEP:
       C:/PROGRA~1/Java/j2re1.4.2_12 
       ;

You should now be able to build pdf docs via:

    bjam pdf
