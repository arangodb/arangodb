    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <div> The Boost Preprocessing library is a library of macros, with support
      for preprocessor metaprogramming. The library supports both C++ and C
      compilation. It does not depend on any other Boost libraries and therefore
      may be used as a standalone library. </div>
    <div> An excerpt from <i>C++ Template Metaprogramming: Concepts, Tools, and
        Techniques from Boost and Beyond</i> by Dave Abrahams and Aleksey
      Gurtovoy has been made <a href="AppendixA-AnIntroductiontoPreprocessorMetaprogramming.html"
        target="_top"><font color="blue"><b><u><i>available</i></u></b></font></a>.
      This excerpt contains a basic introduction to the Preprocessor library and
      preprocessor metaprogramming which may help users new to the library and
      users interested in seeing some of the facilities offered by the library.
