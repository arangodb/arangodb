[section Change log]

[h4 Boost.Test v3.6 / boost 1.65]

[h5 Breaking changes]
* __BOOST_GLOBAL_FIXTURE__ is flagged as deprecated and will be removed in a later version
* Using test assertions and macros is not allowed when used inside __BOOST_GLOBAL_FIXTURE__. Please use __BOOST_TEST_GLOBAL_FIXTURE__
  instead (see below).
* the interface for loggers has slightly changed to take into account the current log level. This is for addressing [ticket 12631].

[h5 New features]
* VS2017 / C++17 compatibility (thanks to Daniela Engert)
* Deprecating __BOOST_GLOBAL_FIXTURE__ in favor of __BOOST_TEST_GLOBAL_FIXTURE__ and __BOOST_TEST_GLOBAL_CONFIGURATION__. This
  helps separating the logic of the fixtures associated to the master test suite, from the one used for setting up the logging
  and reporting facility, and results in a general cleaner design.
* It is possible to use now the __BOOST_TEST__ check to comparing a collection with respect to regular arrays. See
  [link ref_boost_test_coll_c_arrays this section] for more details.

[h5 Bugfixes and feature requests]
# [pull_request 106] replace deprecated binders and adapters, and `random_shuffle` by more modern equivalents
# [ticket 5282] Test fixtures do not support virtual inheritance
# [ticket 5563] using a test macro in a global fixture crashes Boost.Test
# [ticket 11471] array is a sequence
# [ticket 11962] `BOOST_TEST_MESSAGE` in fixture constructor - invalid XML
# [ticket 12228] Some test headers fail to compile independently
# [ticket 12631] `BOOST_TEST_MESSAGE` generates incorrect output when used in `BOOST_DATA_TEST_CASE`
# [ticket 13011] `BOOST_TEST` broken with floating point relational operators

[h4 Boost.Test v3.5 / boost 1.64]

[h5 New features]
* Now Boost.Test provides [link ref_log_output_custom_customization_point customization points] for logging user defined types:
  this solution is less intrusive than forcing the definition of `operator<<` for a specific type.
* [link boost_test.test_output.log_formats.log_junit_format JUnit output format] can now have a
  [link boost_test.test_output.log_formats.test_log_output log-level] set between `success` and
  `non-fatal error`, and defaults to `general information`.
* [link boost_test.test_output.log_formats.log_junit_format JUnit output format] is now more
  performant in case a lot of checks are done in a test module.

[h5 Bugfixes and feature requests]
# [pull_request 107] `BOOST_NO_EXCEPTIONS` typo making `throw_exception` unusable under some circumstances
# [pull_request 108] Change capital variable names to lowercase
# [ticket 11756] boost.Test: non standards compliant use of `FE_*` macros (unable to compile boost test library on FPU-less arches) (reopened)
# [ticket 12540] Provide customisation point for printing types in tests
# [ticket 12712] `BOOST_AUTO_TEST_SUITE`: Generate unique names by using `__COUNTER__`
# [ticket 12748] Boost.Test defines a variable called `VERSION`
# [ticket 12778] Boost.Test is broken against left shift operator in certain cases (`nullptr` issue)

[h4 Boost.Test v3.4 / boost 1.63]

[h5 Breaking changes]
# Now colons that appear in test case names are replaced with underscores. This affect mainly the
  [link boost_test.tests_organization.test_cases.test_organization_templates template/typed test cases].
  The change is needed since the colon '`:`' is interpreted as a filter separators since 1.62, and it is
  otherwise not possible to execute the tests reported by `--list_content`. See [ticket 12531] for more details.

[h5 New features]
* Now [link boost_test_coll_perelement `per_element`] and [link boost_test_coll_default_lex `lexicographic`] modifiers of __BOOST_TEST__
  can also be applied to string comparison. See
  [link boost_test.testing_tools.extended_comparison.strings string comparison] for more details.

[h5 Bugfixes and feature requests]
# [pull_request 103] Syntactic change silences latest gcc warnings
# [pull_request 105] Fix unused parameter warnings/errors with gcc 6
# [ticket 11756] boost.Test: non standards compliant use of `FE_*` macros (unable to compile boost test library on FPU-less arches)
# [ticket 11907] Why does `BOOST_TEST()` treat `std::string` as a collection?
# [ticket 12339] Propose users given way to disable blink in colour output
# [ticket 12506] typo in Boost.test `report_sink` description
# [ticket 12507] Boost.test `--report_sink` parameter broken
# [ticket 12530] No way to find out Boost.Test version without running any tests
# [ticket 12531] `--run_test` in Boost 1.62 does not accept test names which contain ':'

[h4 Boost.Test v3.3 / boost 1.62]

[h5 New features]
* Boost.Test now treats each sample of a dataset test case as being a uniquely named test case under the same test suite,
  which enables the (re)run of one particular sample from the command line interface. See
  [link boost_test.tests_organization.test_cases.test_case_generation.datasets_auto_registration.samples_and_test_tree here]
  for more details,
* Boost.Test learned to interpret ':' as a separator for the test filters: the string passed to
  [link boost_test.utf_reference.rt_param_reference.run_test `--run_test`]
  generates tokens as if `--run_test` has been repeated, which enables the set up of several test filters
  through the associated environment variable `BOOST_TEST_RUN_FILTERS`
* the __UTF__ learned to log the messages in the xUnit/JUNIT log format.
  See [link boost_test.test_output.log_formats.log_junit_format here] for more details.
* the __UTF__ learned to have several loggers at the same time, each of which with their own log level and log sink.
  See the associated command line switch [link boost_test.utf_reference.rt_param_reference.logger `--logger`] and
  corresponding environment variable `BOOST_TEST_LOGGER` for more details.
* loggers are now able to indicate their default output stream and log level.

[h5 Bugfixes and feature requests]
# [pull_request 81] Possibility to remove the support of the alternative stack at compilation time. See
  [link boost_test.utf_reference.link_references.config_disable_alt_stack `BOOST_TEST_DISABLE_ALT_STACK`] for more details.
# [ticket 8707] Provide Standard xUnit XML Output from Boost Test
# [ticket 8834] Boost Test should be able to generate report in both XML and HRF together
# [ticket 11128] `[bb10/qnx failures]` Build error
# [ticket 11845] Ability to generate the unique and stable test name for every data set in `BOOST_DATA_TEST_CASE`
# [ticket 11859] Wrong handling of "," in Run-Parameters
# [ticket 12024] boost test depends on nonexisting `abi::__cxa_demangle` on android
# [ticket 12093] Boost 1.60.0: Build fails (gcc 4.6)
# [ticket 12103] Fix for gcc bug 58952 (`getchar()` is defined as a macro in `uClibc`)
# [ticket 12224] Crash on MSVC with RTTI disabled
# [ticket 12241] Data-driven testing over a range of `std::tuple` has broken
# [ticket 12257] Incorrect line numbers in `test_units` generated from `test_case_gen`
# [ticket 12378] Compilation errors with clang 3.8

[h4 Boost.Test v3.2 / boost 1.61]

[h5 New features]
* now datasets support any [link boost_test.tests_organization.test_cases.test_case_generation.datasets arity], using the
  variadic template support of the compiler.
* now datasets support fixtures through `BOOST_DATA_TEST_CASE_F`, see
  [link boost_test.tests_organization.test_cases.test_case_generation.datasets here] for more details
* now datasets honors move semantics of the types used for samples

[h5 Bugfixes and feature requests]
# [ticket 6767] Use of namespace qualifier with floating point exception functions breaks if they are macros
# [ticket 8905] `boost/test/impl/debug.ipp`: Ignores return value from `WaitForSingleObject`
# [ticket 9443] Runtime parameter Random seed for random order of test cases not respected correctly
# [ticket 11854] Add fixture support in `BOOST_DATA_TEST_CASE`
# [ticket 11887] `BOOST_TEST(3u == (std::max)(0u, 3u))` fails
# [ticket 11889] `BOOST_DATA_TEST_CASE` fails to compile for 4D and higher dimensional grids
# [ticket 11983] Boost Test XML Report contains unescaped XML characters

[h4 Boost.Test v3.1 / boost 1.60]

[h5 New major features]
* improved API for datasets
  * it is now possible to use initializer lists
  * the use of `make` as top left dataset is not necessary anymore
* improved command line interface
  * clearer help commands
  * now proposes closest matching command in case of ambiguity
  * reports invalid or ambiguous parameters: this might break existing calls when user defined commands are
    provided to the test module. The following calling convention should be adopted:
    * if the test module uses user supplied commands, those should be passed after an empty token `--`
    * all boost.test related commands should be passed before `--`, if any

    Example:
    the call
    ``
    test_module --user-arg1=xy --log_level=test_suite
    ``
    should be rewritten to
    ``
    test_module --log_level=test_suite -- --user-arg1=xy
    ``

[h4 Boost.Test v3 / boost 1.59]

[h5 New major features]

* __BOOST_TEST__ generic assertion
* [link boost_test.tests_organization.test_cases.test_case_generation data driven test cases]: supersedes the parametric test case (unary test cases)
* test units [link boost_test.tests_organization.decorators attributes], that allow finer control over test units property and behavior
* logical grouping of the test units using [link boost_test.tests_organization.tests_grouping labels]
* support for declaring [link boost_test.tests_organization.tests_dependencies dependencies] over test cases
* attributes for [link boost_test.tests_organization.enabling enabling or disabling] test execution based on static, compile-time or runtime rules
