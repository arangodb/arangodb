[section:requirements Requirements]

If __boost_context__ uses fcontext_t (the default) as its implementation,
it must be built for the particular compiler(s) and CPU architecture(s)
being targeted.
Using [link implementation ['fcontext_t]], __boost_context__ includes assembly
code and, therefore, requires GNU as and GNU preprocessor for supported POSIX
systems, MASM for Windows/x86 systems and ARMasm for Windows/arm systems.

[note MASM64 (ml64.exe) is a part of Microsoft's Windows Driver Kit.]

[important Please note that `address-model=64` must be given to bjam command
line on 64bit Windows for 64bit build; otherwise 32bit code will be generated.]

[important For cross-compiling the lib you must specify certain additional
properties at bjam command line: `target-os`, `abi`, `binary-format`,
`architecture` and `address-model`.]

[important For safe SEH the property 'asmflags=\safeseh' must be specified at
bjam command line.]
