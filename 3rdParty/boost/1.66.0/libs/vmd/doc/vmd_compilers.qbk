[section:vmd_compilers Compilers]

On Windows I have tested this library using gcc/MingW, VC++, and clang targeting gcc.
The compilers tested are gcc 4.3.0, 4.4.0, 4.5.0-1, 4.5.2-1, 4.6.0,
4.6.1, 4.6.2, 4.7.0, 4.7.2, 4.8.1, 4.8.2, 4.8.3, 4.8.4, 4.8.5, 4.9.0, 4.9.1, 4.9.2, 4.9.3,
5.1.0, 5.2.0, VC++ 8.0, 9.0, 10.0, 11.0, 12.0, 14.0. and clang 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, and the 
latest clang build from source.

On Linux I have tested this library using gcc 4.4.7, 4.6.4, 4.7.3, 4.8.2, 4.8.3, 4.9.1, 
clang 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, and the latest clang build from source, and Intel C++ 12.1. 13.0, 
14.0, 15.0, 16.0.

For VC++ 8.0 the BOOST_VMD_IS_EMPTY and BOOST_VMD_ASSERT_IS_EMPTY macros
take a single parameter rather than variadic data because this 
version of VC++ does not accept variadic data which may be empty.

The compilers supported are those which are deemed to offer C99/C++11 
variadic macro support for Boost PP as represented by the BOOST_PP_VARIADICS macro.
