[section:SyncWriteStream Buffer-oriented synchronous write stream requirements]

A type `X` meets the `SyncWriteStream` requirements if it satisfies the
requirements listed below.

In the table below, `a` denotes a value of type `X`, `cb` denotes a (possibly
const) value satisfying the [link boost_asio.reference.ConstBufferSequence
`ConstBufferSequence`] requirements, and `ec` denotes an object of type
`error_code`.

      Meets the requirements for a [link boost_asio.reference.read_write_operations
      write operation].\n
      \n
      If `buffer_size(cb) > 0`, writes one or more bytes of data to the stream
      `a` from the buffer sequence `cb`. If successful, sets `ec` such that
      `!ec` is `true`, and returns the number of bytes written. If an error
      occurred, sets `ec` such that `!!ec` is `true`, and returns 0.\n
      \n
      If `buffer_size(cb) == 0`, the operation shall not block. Sets `ec` such
      that `!ec` is `true`, and returns 0.
