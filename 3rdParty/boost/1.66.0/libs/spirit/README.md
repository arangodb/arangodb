spirit
======

Spirit is a set of C++ libraries for parsing and output generation implemented as 
Domain Specific Embedded Languages (DSEL) using Expression templates and Template 
Meta-Programming. The Spirit libraries enable a target grammar to be written 
exclusively in C++. Inline grammar specifications can mix freely with other 
C++ code and, thanks to the generative power of C++ templates, are immediately 
executable.
