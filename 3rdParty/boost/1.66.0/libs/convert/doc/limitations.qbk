[section Supported Compilers]

['Boost.Convert] makes use of SFINAE for correct `boost::convert()` deployment depending on the context. Unfortunately, the correctness and the completeness of SFINAE support varies with different compilers and different versions of those compilers. Consequently, some compilers fail to compile ['Boost.Convert] API (although the actual functionality provided by the converters themselves is probably availabable via other non-standard means). ['Boost.Convert] has been tested through the Boost regression-testing framework with the folowing results: 

* CLANG. Successfully tested with versions from 2.9 to 3.6;

* GCC. Successfully tested with versions from 4.2.1 through to 5.0. Earlier versions were not tested;

* Intel C++ compiler. Successfully tested with versions from 12.1 forward. Earlier versions fail to compile ['Boost.Convert] due to lacking full SFINAE support;

* MSVC. Successfully tested from MSVC 2013 (msvc-12.0) forward. Earlier versions had some components disabled due to lacking full SFINAE support;
