[section Using WebSocket]

The WebSocket Protocol enables two-way communication between a client
running untrusted code in a controlled environment to a remote host that has
opted-in to communications from that code. The protocol consists of an opening
handshake followed by basic message framing, layered over TCP.  The goal of
this technology is to provide a mechanism for browser-based applications
needing two-way communication with servers without relying on opening multiple
HTTP connections.

Beast provides developers with a robust WebSocket implementation built on
Boost.Asio with a consistent asynchronous model using a modern C++ approach.

[note
    This documentation assumes familiarity with __Asio__ and
    the protocol specification described in __rfc6455__.
