[section Parser Stream Operations]

Non-trivial algorithms need to do more than receive entire messages
at once, such as:


* Receive the header first and body later.

* Receive a large body using a fixed-size buffer.

* Receive a message incrementally: bounded work in each I/O cycle.

* Defer the commitment to a __Body__ type until after reading the header.

These types of operations require callers to manage the lifetime of
associated state, by constructing a class derived from __basic_parser__.
Beast comes with the derived instance __parser__ which creates complete
__message__ objects using the __basic_fields__ Fields container.

    /// An HTTP/1 parser for producing a message.

        bool isRequest,                         // `true` to parse an HTTP request
        class Body,                             // The Body type for the resulting message
        class Allocator = std::allocator<char>> // The type of allocator for the header
    class parser
        : public basic_parser<...>;
    ```

    template<class Body, class Allocator = std::allocator<char>>
    using request_parser = parser<true, Body, Allocator>;
    ```

    template<class Body, class Allocator = std::allocator<char>>
    using response_parser = parser<false, Body, Allocator>;
    ```
]]
]

[note
    The __basic_parser__ and classes derived from it handle octet streams
    serialized in the HTTP/1 format described in __rfc7230__.

The stream operations which work on parsers are:

]]

]]

][
    Read only the header octets into a parser asynchronously from an __AsyncWriteStream__.
]]
[[
    [link beast.ref.boost__beast__http__read_some.overload1 [*read_some]]
][
    Read some octets into a parser from a __SyncReadStream__.
]]
[[
    [link beast.ref.boost__beast__http__async_read_some [*async_read_some]]
][
    Read some octets into a parser asynchronously from an __AsyncWriteStream__.
]]
]

As with message stream operations, parser stream operations require a
persisted __DynamicBuffer__  for holding unused octets from the stream.
The basic parser implementation is optimized for the case where this dynamic
buffer stores its input sequence in a single contiguous memory buffer. It is
advised to use an instance of __flat_buffer__, __flat_static_buffer__, or
__flat_static_buffer_base__ for this purpose, although a user defined instance
of __DynamicBuffer__ which produces input sequences of length one is also
suitable.

The parser contains a message constructed internally. Arguments passed
to the parser's constructor are forwarded into the message container.
The caller can access the message inside the parser by calling
[link beast.ref.boost__beast__http__parser.get `parser::get`].
If the `Fields` and `Body` types are [*MoveConstructible], the caller
can take ownership of the message by calling
[link beast.ref.boost__beast__http__parser.release `parser::release`]. In this example
we read an HTTP response with a string body using a parser, then print
the response:

[section Incremental Read]

This function uses
[link beast.ref.boost__beast__http__buffer_body `buffer_body`]
and parser stream operations to read a message body progressively
using a small, fixed-size buffer:
