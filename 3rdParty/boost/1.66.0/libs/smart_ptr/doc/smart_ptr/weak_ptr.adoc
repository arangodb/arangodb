## Description

The `weak_ptr` class template stores a "weak reference" to an object that's already managed by a `shared_ptr`.
To access the object, a `weak_ptr` can be converted to a `shared_ptr` using the `shared_ptr` constructor taking
`weak_ptr`, or the `weak_ptr` member function `lock`. When the last `shared_ptr` to the object goes away and the
object is deleted, the attempt to obtain a `shared_ptr` from the `weak_ptr` instances that refer to the deleted
object will fail: the constructor will throw an exception of type `boost::bad_weak_ptr`, and `weak_ptr::lock` will
return an empty `shared_ptr`.

Every `weak_ptr` meets the `CopyConstructible` and `Assignable` requirements of the {cpp} Standard Library, and so
can be used in standard library containers. Comparison operators are supplied so that `weak_ptr` works with the standard
library's associative containers.

`weak_ptr` operations never throw exceptions.

The class template is parameterized on `T`, the type of the object pointed to.

Compared to `shared_ptr`, `weak_ptr` provides a very limited subset of operations since accessing its stored pointer is
often dangerous in multithreaded programs, and sometimes unsafe even within a single thread (that is, it may invoke undefined
behavior.) Pretend for a moment that `weak_ptr` had a get member function that returned a raw pointer, and consider this innocent
piece of code:

```
shared_ptr<int> p(new int(5));
weak_ptr<int> q(p);

// some time later

if(int * r = q.get())
{
    // use *r
}
```

Imagine that after the `if`, but immediately before `r` is used, another thread executes the statement `p.reset()`. Now `r` is a dangling pointer.

The solution to this problem is to create a temporary `shared_ptr` from `q`:

```
shared_ptr<int> p(new int(5));
weak_ptr<int> q(p);

// some time later

if(shared_ptr<int> r = q.lock())
{
    // use *r
}
```

Now `r` holds a reference to the object that was pointed by `q`. Even if `p.reset()` is executed in another thread, the object will stay alive until
`r` goes out of scope or is reset. By obtaining a `shared_ptr` to the object, we have effectively locked it against destruction.

## Synopsis

`weak_ptr` is defined in `<boost/smart_ptr/weak_ptr.hpp>`.

```
namespace boost {

  template<class T> class weak_ptr {
  public:

    typedef /*see below*/ element_type;

    weak_ptr() noexcept;

    template<class Y> weak_ptr(shared_ptr<Y> const & r) noexcept;
    weak_ptr(weak_ptr const & r) noexcept;
    template<class Y> weak_ptr(weak_ptr<Y> const & r) noexcept;

    weak_ptr(weak_ptr && r) noexcept;

    ~weak_ptr() noexcept;

    weak_ptr & operator=(weak_ptr const & r) noexcept;
    weak_ptr & operator=(weak_ptr && r) noexcept;
    template<class Y> weak_ptr & operator=(weak_ptr<Y> const & r) noexcept;
    template<class Y> weak_ptr & operator=(shared_ptr<Y> const & r) noexcept;

    long use_count() const noexcept;
    bool expired() const noexcept;

    shared_ptr<T> lock() const noexcept;

    void reset() noexcept;

    void swap(weak_ptr<T> & b) noexcept;

    template<class Y> bool owner_before( weak_ptr<Y> const & r ) const noexcept;
    template<class Y> bool owner_before( shared_ptr<Y> const & r ) const noexcept;
  };

  template<class T, class U>
    bool operator<(weak_ptr<T> const & a, weak_ptr<U> const & b) noexcept;

  template<class T> void swap(weak_ptr<T> & a, weak_ptr<T> & b) noexcept;
}
```

## Members

### element_type
```
typedef ... element_type;
```
`element_type` is `T` when `T` is not an array type, and `U` when `T` is `U[]` or `U[N]`.

### constructors
```
weak_ptr() noexcept;
```
[none]
* {blank}
+
Effects:: Constructs an empty `weak_ptr`.
Postconditions:: `use_count() == 0`.

```
template<class Y> weak_ptr(shared_ptr<Y> const & r) noexcept;
```
```
weak_ptr(weak_ptr const & r) noexcept;
```
```
template<class Y> weak_ptr(weak_ptr<Y> const & r) noexcept;
```
[none]
* {blank}
+
Effects:: If `r` is empty, constructs an empty `weak_ptr`; otherwise, constructs a `weak_ptr` that shares ownership with `r` as if by storing a copy of the pointer stored in `r`.
Postconditions:: `use_count() == r.use_count()`.

```
weak_ptr(weak_ptr && r) noexcept;
```
[none]
* {blank}
+
Effects:: Constructs a `weak_ptr` that has the value `r` held.
Postconditions:: `r` is empty.

### destructor
```
~weak_ptr() noexcept;
```
[none]
* {blank}
+
Effects:: Destroys this `weak_ptr` but has no effect on the object its stored pointer points to.

### assignment
```
weak_ptr & operator=(weak_ptr const & r) noexcept;
```
```
weak_ptr & operator=(weak_ptr && r) noexcept;
```
```
template<class Y> weak_ptr & operator=(weak_ptr<Y> const & r) noexcept;
```
```
template<class Y> weak_ptr & operator=(shared_ptr<Y> const & r) noexcept;
```
[none]
* {blank}
+
Effects:: Equivalent to `weak_ptr(r).swap(*this)`.

NOTE: The implementation is free to meet the effects (and the implied guarantees) via different means, without creating a temporary.

### use_count
```
long use_count() const noexcept;
```
[none]
* {blank}
+
Returns:: 0 if `*this` is empty; otherwise, the number of `shared_ptr` objects that share ownership with `*this`.

### expired

bool expired() const noexcept;
```
[none]
* {blank}
+
Returns:: `use_count() == 0`.

### lock
```
shared_ptr<T> lock() const noexcept;
```
[none]
* {blank}
+
Returns:: `expired()? shared_ptr<T>(): shared_ptr<T>(*this)`.

### reset
```
void reset() noexcept;
```
[none]
* {blank}
+
Effects:: Equivalent to `weak_ptr().swap(*this)`.

### swap
```
void swap(weak_ptr & b) noexcept;
```
[none]
* {blank}
+
Effects:: Exchanges the contents of the two smart pointers.

```
template<class Y> bool owner_before( weak_ptr<Y> const & r ) const noexcept;
```
```
template<class Y> bool owner_before( shared_ptr<Y> const & r ) const noexcept;
```
[none]
* {blank}
+
Returns:: See the description of `operator<`.

## Free Functions

### comparison
```
template<class T, class U>
  bool operator<(weak_ptr<T> const & a, weak_ptr<U> const & b) noexcept;
```
[none]
* {blank}
+
Returns:: An unspecified value such that
- `operator<` is a strict weak ordering as described in section [lib.alg.sorting] of the {cpp} standard; 
- under the equivalence relation defined by `operator<`, `!(a < b) && !(b < a)`, two `weak_ptr` instances
  are equivalent if and only if they share ownership or are both empty.

NOTE: Allows `weak_ptr` objects to be used as keys in associative containers.

### swap
```
template<class T> void swap(weak_ptr<T> & a, weak_ptr<T> & b) noexcept;
```
[none]
* {blank}
+
Effects:: Equivalent to `a.swap(b)`.

## Frequently Asked Questions

[qanda]
Can an object create a weak_ptr to itself in its constructor?::

  No. A `weak_ptr` can only be created from a `shared_ptr`, and at object construction time no
  `shared_ptr` to the object exists yet. Even if you could create a temporary `shared_ptr` to `this`,
  it would go out of scope at the end of the constructor, and all `weak_ptr` instances would instantly expire.
+
The solution is to make the constructor private, and supply a factory function that returns a `shared_ptr`:
+
```
class X
{
private:

    X();

public:

    static shared_ptr<X> create()
    {
        shared_ptr<X> px(new X);
        // create weak pointers from px here
        return px;
    }
};
```
