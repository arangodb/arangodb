<h2><a name="Abstract">Abstract</a></h2>

<p>Boost.Endian provides facilities to manipulate the 
<a href="#Introduction-to-endianness">endianness</a> of integers and user-defined types.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Three approaches to endianness are supported. Each has a 
  long history of successful use, and each approach has use cases where it is 
  preferred over the other approaches.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Primary uses:<br>
&nbsp;<ul>
  <li>Data portability. The Endian library supports binary data exchange, via either external media or network transmission, 
  regardless of platform endianness.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Program portability. POSIX-based and 
  Windows-based operating systems traditionally supply libraries with 
  non-portable functions to perform endian conversion. There are at least four 
  incompatible sets of functions in common use. The Endian library is 
  portable across all C++ platforms.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

  </li>
  <li>Secondary use: Minimizing data size via sizes and/or alignments not supported by the 
  standard C++ integer types.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Introduction-to-endianness">Introduction to endianness</a></h2>

<p>Consider the following code:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>int16_t i = 0x0102;
FILE * file = fopen(&quot;test.bin&quot;, &quot;wb&quot;);   // binary file!
fwrite(&amp;i, sizeof(int16_t), 1, file);
fclose(file);</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>On OS X, Linux, or Windows systems with an Intel CPU, a hex dump 
of the &quot;test.bin&quot; output file produces:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>0201</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On OS X systems with a PowerPC CPU, or Solaris systems with a SPARC CPU, a hex dump of the &quot;test.bin&quot; 
output file produces:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>0102</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What's happening here is that Intel CPUs order the bytes of an integer with 
the least-significant byte first, while SPARC CPUs place the most-significant 
byte first. Some CPUs, such as the PowerPC, allow the operating system to 
choose which ordering applies.</p>
<p><a name="definition"></a>Most-significant-byte-first ordering is traditionally called &quot;big endian&quot; 
ordering and  least-significant-byte-first is traditionally called 
&quot;little-endian&quot; ordering. The names are derived from
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Swift" title="Jonathan Swift">
Jonathan Swift</a>'s satirical novel <i>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulliver's_Travels" title="Gulliver's Travels">
Gulliverâ€™s Travels</a></i>, where rival kingdoms opened their soft-boiled eggs 
at different ends.</p>
<p>See Wikipedia's
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">Endianness</a> article for an 
extensive discussion of endianness.</p>
<p>Programmers can usually ignore endianness, except when reading a core 
dump on little-endian systems. But programmers  have to deal with endianness  when exchanging binary integers and binary floating point 
values between computer systems with differing endianness, whether by physical file transfer or over a network. 
And programmers may also want to use the library when minimizing either internal or 
external data sizes is advantageous.</p>
<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a> to the Boost.Endian library</h2>

<p>Boost.Endian provides three different approaches to dealing with 
 
endianness. All three approaches support integers and user-define types (UDTs).</p>

<p>Each approach has a long history of successful use, and each approach has use 
cases where it is preferred to the other approaches.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b><a href="conversion.html">Endian conversion functions</a> -</b> The 
application uses the built-in integer types to hold values, and calls the 
provided conversion functions to convert byte ordering as needed. Both mutating 
and non-mutating conversions are supplied, and each comes in unconditional and 
conditional variants.</p>

<p><b><a href="buffers.html">Endian buffer types</a> -</b> The application uses the provided endian 
buffer types 
to hold values, and explicitly converts to and from the built-in integer types.  Buffer sizes of 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, and 64 bits (i.e. 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 bytes) are provided. Unaligned integer buffer types 
are provided for all sizes, and aligned buffer types are provided for 16, 32, and 
64-bit sizes. The provided specific types are typedefs for a generic class 
template that may be used directly for less common use cases.</p>

<p><b><a href="arithmetic.html">Endian arithmetic types</a> -</b> The 
application uses the provided endian arithmetic types, which supply the same 
operations as the built-in C++ arithmetic types. All conversions are implicit. 
Arithmetic sizes of 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, and 64 bits (i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 
6, 7, and 8 bytes) are provided. Unaligned integer types are provided for all 
sizes and aligned 
arithmetic types are provided for 16, 32, and 64-bit sizes. The provided 
specific types are typedefs for a generic class template that may be used 
directly in generic code of for less common use cases.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Boost Endian is a header-only library. C++11 features 
affecting interfaces, such as <code>noexcept</code>, are  used only if available. 
See <a href="#C++03-support">C++03 support for C++11 features</a> for details.</p>

<h2><a name="Choosing">Choosing</a> between  conversion functions,  buffer types, 
and  arithmetic types</h2>

<p>This section has been moved to its own <a href="choosing_approach.html">
Choosing the Approach</a> page. </p>

<h2>Built-in support for <a name="Intrinsic">Intrinsic</a>s</h2>
<p>Most compilers, including GCC, Clang, and Visual C++, supply  built-in support for byte swapping intrinsics. 
The Endian library uses these intrinsics when available since they may result in smaller and faster generated code, particularly for 
optimized 
builds.</p>
<p>Defining the macro <code>BOOST_ENDIAN_NO_INTRINSICS</code> will suppress use 
of the intrinsics. This is useful when a compiler has no intrinsic support or 
fails to locate the appropriate header, perhaps because it 
is an older release or has very limited supporting libraries.</p>
<p>The macro <code>BOOST_ENDIAN_INTRINSIC_MSG</code> is defined as 
either <code>&quot;no byte swap intrinsics&quot;</code> or a string describing the 
particular set of intrinsics being used. This is useful for eliminating missing 
intrinsics as a source of performance issues.</p>

<h2><a name="Performance">Performance</a></h2>

<p>Consider this problem:</p>

  </tr>

  </center>
</div>

<p><b>There will be no performance difference between the two approaches in 
optimized builds, 
regardless of the native endianness of the machine.</b> That&#39;s because optimizing compilers will  generate exactly the same code for each. That conclusion was confirmed by 
studying the generated assembly code for GCC and Visual C++. Furthermore, time 
spent doing I/O will determine the speed of this application.</p>

</div>

<p>With the Endian arithmetic approach, on little endian platforms an implicit conversion from and then back to 
big endian is done inside the loop. With the Endian conversion function 
approach, the user has ensured the conversions are done outside the loop, so the 
code may run more quickly on little endian platforms.</p>

<h3><a name="Timings">Timings</a></h3>
<p>These tests were run against release builds on a circa 2012 4-core little endian X64 Intel Core i5-3570K 
CPU @ 3.40GHz under Windows 7.</p>

<p><b>Caveat emptor: The Windows CPU timer has very high granularity. Repeated 
runs of the same tests often yield considerably different results.</b></p>

<h2>Overall <a name="FAQ">FAQ</a></h2>

<p><b>Is the implementation header only?</b></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><b>Are C++03 compilers supported?</b></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><b>Does the implementation use compiler intrinsic built-in byte swapping?</b></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes, if available. See <a href="#Intrinsic">Intrinsic built-in support</a>.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><b>Why bother with endianness?</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Binary data portability is the primary use case.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Does endianness have any uses outside of portable binary file or network 
I/O formats?</b> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using the unaligned integer types with a size tailored to the application&#39;s 
needs is a minor secondary use that saves internal or external memory space. For 
example, using <code>big_int40_buf_t</code> or <code>big_int40_t</code> in a 
large array saves a lot of space compared to one of the 64-bit types.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Why bother with binary I/O? Why not just use C++ Standard Library stream 
inserters and extractors?</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Data interchange formats often specify binary integer data.</p>
<p>Binary integer data is smaller and therefore I/O is faster and file sizes 
are smaller. Transfer between systems is less expensive.</p>
<p >Furthermore, binary integer data is of fixed size, and so fixed-size disk 
records are possible without padding, easing sorting and allowing random access.</p>
<p >Disadvantages, such as the inability to use text utilities on the 
resulting files, limit usefulness to applications where the binary I/O 
advantages are paramount.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Which is better, big-endian or little-endian?</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Big-endian tends to be preferred in a networking environment and is a bit 
more of an industry standard, but little-endian may be preferred for 
applications that run primarily on x86, x86-64, and other little-endian 
CPU's. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endian">Wikipedia</a> article 
gives more pros and cons.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Why are only big and little native endianness supported?</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p>These are the only endian schemes that have any practical value today. PDP-11 
and the other middle endian approaches are interesting  curiosities 
but have no relevance for today&#39;s C++ developers. The same is true for 
architectures that allow runtime endianness switching. The
<a href="conversion.html#native-order-specification">specification for native 
ordering</a> has been carefully crafted to allow support for such orderings in 
the future, should the need arise. Thanks to Howard Hinnant for suggesting this. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Why do both the buffer and arithmetic types exist?</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Conversions in the buffer types are explicit. Conversions in the arithmetic 
types are implicit. This fundamental difference is a deliberate design feature 
that would be lost if the inheritance hierarchy were collapsed.</p>
<p>The original design provided only arithmetic types. Buffer types were 
requested during formal review by those wishing total control over when 
conversion occurs. They also felt that buffer types would be less likely to be 
misused by maintenance programmers not familiar with the implications of 
performing a lot of integer operations on the endian arithmetic integer types.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>What is gained by using the buffer types rather than always just using the 
arithmetic types?</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Assurance that hidden conversions are not performed. This is of overriding 
importance to users concerned about achieving the ultimate in terms of speed. </p>
<p>&quot;Always just using the arithmetic types&quot; is fine for other users. When the 
ultimate in speed needs to be ensured, the arithmetic types can be used in the 
same design patterns or idioms that would be used for buffer types, resulting in 
the same code being generated for either types.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>What are the limitations of integer support?</b></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Tests have only been 
performed on machines that  use two's complement arithmetic. The Endian 
conversion functions only support 16, 32, and 64-bit aligned integers. The 
endian types only support 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, and 64-bit unaligned integers, 
and 8, 16, 32, and 64-bit aligned integers.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><b>Why is there no floating point support?</b></p>

<blockquote>

<p>An attempt was made to support four-byte <code>float</code>s and eight-byte
<code>double</code>s, limited to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_floating_point">IEEE 754</a> (also 
know as ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559) floating point and further limited to systems where 
floating point endianness does not differ from integer 
endianness.</p>

<p>Even with those limitations, support for floating point types was not 
reliable and was removed. For example, simply reversing the endianness of a 
floating point number can result in a signaling-NAN. For all practical purposes, 
binary serialization and endianness for integers are one and the same problem. 
That is not true for floating point numbers, so binary serialization interfaces 
and formats for floating point does not fit well in an endian-based library.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Header <code>boost/endian/endian.hpp</code> has been renamed to <code>

  <code>boost/endian/conversion.hpp</code> and <code>boost/endian/buffers.hpp</code> have been 
  added. 
  Infrastructure file names were changed accordingly.</li>
  <li>The endian arithmetic type aliases have been renamed, 
  using a naming pattern that is consistent for both integer and floating point, 
  and a consistent set of aliases supplied for the endian buffer types.</li>
  <li>The unaligned-type alias names still have the <code>_t</code> suffix, but

  <li>For X86 and X64 architectures, which permit unaligned loads and stores, 
  unaligned little endian buffer and arithmetic types use regular loads and 
  stores when the size is exact. This makes unaligned little endian buffer and 
  arithmetic types significantly more efficient on these architectures. (Jeremy

<h2><a name="Compatibility">Compatibility</a> with interim releases</h2>

<p>Prior to the official Boost release, class template <code>
endian_arithmetic</code> has been used for a decade or more with the same 
functionality but under the name <code>endian</code>. Other names also changed 
in the official release. If the macro <code>BOOST_ENDIAN_DEPRECATED_NAMES</code> 
is defined, those old now deprecated names are still supported. However, the 
class template <code>endian</code> name is only provided for compilers 
supporting C++11 template aliases. For C++03 compilers, the name will have to be 
changed to <code>endian_arithmetic</code>.</p>

<p>To support backward header compatibility, deprecated header <code>boost/endian/endian.hpp</code> 
forwards to <code>boost/endian/arithmetic.hpp</code>. It requires <code>
BOOST_ENDIAN_DEPRECATED_NAMES</code> be defined. It should only be used while 
transitioning to the official Boost release of the library as it will be removed 
in some future release.</p>
