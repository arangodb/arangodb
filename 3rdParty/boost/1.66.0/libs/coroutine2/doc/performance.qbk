[section:performance Performance]

Performance measurements were taken using `std::chrono::highresolution_clock`,
with overhead corrections.
The code was compiled with gcc-6.3.1, using build options:
variant = release, optimization = speed.
Tests were executed on dual Intel XEON E5 2620v4 2.2GHz, 16C/32T, 64GB RAM,
running Linux (x86_64).
