/** Read part of a message from a stream using a parser.

    This function is used to read part of a message from a stream into a
    subclass of @ref basic_parser.
    The call will block until one of the following conditions is true:

    @li A call to @ref basic_parser::put with a non-empty buffer sequence
    is successful.

    @li An error occurs.

    This operation is implemented in terms of one or
    more calls to the stream's `read_some` function.
    The implementation may read additional octets that lie past the
    end of the message being read. This additional data is stored
    in the dynamic buffer, which must be retained for subsequent reads.

    If the stream returns the error `boost::asio::error::eof` indicating the
    end of file during a read, the error returned from this function will be:

    @li @ref error::end_of_stream if no octets were parsed, or

    @li @ref error::partial_message if any octets were parsed but the
    message was incomplete, otherwise:

    @li A successful result. A subsequent attempt to read will
    return @ref error::end_of_stream

    @param stream The stream from which the data is to be read.
    The type must support the @b SyncReadStream concept.

    @param buffer A @b DynamicBuffer holding additional bytes
    read by the implementation from the stream. This is both
    an input and an output parameter; on entry, any data in the
    dynamic buffer's input sequence will be given to the parser
    first.

    @param parser The parser to use.

    @return The number of bytes transferred to the parser.

    immediately or not, the handler will not be invoked from within

    The completion handler will receive as a parameter the number

    first.

    @param msg An object in which to store the message contents.
    This object should not have previous contents, otherwise
    the behavior is undefined.
    The type must be @b MoveAssignable and @b MoveConstructible.

    The object must remain valid at least until the
    handler is called; ownership is not transferred.

    @param handler The handler to be called when the operation
    completes. Copies will be made of the handler as required.
    The equivalent function signature of the handler must be:
    @code void handler(
        error_code const& error,        // result of operation,
        std::size_t bytes_transferred   // the number of bytes transferred to the parser
    ); @endcode
    Regardless of whether the asynchronous operation completes
    immediately or not, the handler will not be invoked from within
    this function. Invocation of the handler will be performed in a
    manner equivalent to using `boost::asio::io_context::post`.
