[section:Protocol Protocol requirements]

A type `X` meets the `Protocol` requirements if it satisfies the requirements
of `Destructible` (C++Std [destructible]), `CopyConstructible` (C++Std
[copyconstructible]), and `CopyAssignable` (C++Std [copyassignable]), as well
as the additional requirements listed below.

No copy or move operation of the type `X` shall exit via an exception.

[table Protocol requirements
  [[expression] [return type] [assertion/note[br]pre/post-conditions]]
  [
    [`X::endpoint`]
    [type meeting [link boost_asio.reference.Endpoint endpoint] requirements]
    []
  ]
]

In the table below, `a` denotes a (possibly const) value of type `X`.
