[heading Asio 1.20.0 / Boost 1.77]

* Added support for cancellation of individual asynchronous operations.
  Cancellation is implemented by having each completion handler carry an
  associated `CancellationSlot`, a lightweight cancellation channel that is
  specified through the new `associated_cancellation_slot` associator. A
  concrete `CancellationSlot` implementation is provided in the form of the
  `cancellation_signal` and `cancellation_slot` classes. In conjunction with
  the `bind_cancellation_slot` helper function, these may be used to hook
  cancellation into asynchronous operations. However, it should be noted that
  these classes are the low-level building blocks of cancellation, and most use
  cases should use a higher level abstraction for cancellation, such as
  `experimental::parallel_group` or the new logical operators for `awaitable`
  (see below). The ability to cancel individual operations, or composed
  operations, is currently supported by:
  * timers
  * sockets on POSIX and Windows
  * POSIX descriptors
  * Windows HANDLEs
  * SSL streams
  * all Asio-provided composed operations such as `async_read` and `async_write`
  * compositions based on `async_compose`
  * C++20 coroutines that use `awaitable`
  * C++20 coroutines that use the new `experimental::coro` (see below)
  * the new `experimental::parallel_group` operation (see below)
  * the new `experimental::promise` class (see below)
* Added the `associator` trait. The `associator` trait is used to generically
  forward associators, such as `associated_executor` and `associated_allocator`,
  through intermediate completion handlers. For example:[br]
  ``
  template <typename Handler>
  struct intermediate_handler
  {
    Handler handler_;

    template <typename... Args>
    void operator()(Args&... args)
    {
      // ...
    }
  };

  namespace asio {
    template <
        template <typename, typename> class Associator,
        typename Handler,
        typename DefaultCandidate>
    struct associator<
        Associator,
        intermediate_handler<Handler>,
        DefaultCandidate>
    {
      using type =
        typename Associator<Handler, DefaultCandidate>::type;

      static type get(
          const intermediate_handler<Handler>& h,
          const DefaultCandidate& c = DefaultCandidate()) noexcept
      {
        return Associator<Handler, DefaultCandidate>::get(
            h.handler_, c);
      }
    };
  } // namespace asio
  ``[br]
* Changed all asynchronous operations implemented in Asio to invoke their
  completion handlers as rvalue references. This allows an rvalue reference
  qualifier to be added to the function call operator.
* Added support for asynchronous operations with multiple completion signatures.
  Completion signatures may also specify that they are `noexcept`, and whether
  they are lvalue-invocable (and thus do not "consume" the completion handler)
  or rvalue-invocable (and thus do "consume" the handler, indicating an end to
  the asynchronous operation). For example:[br]
  ``
  auto my_async_operation(...,
      asio::completion_token_for<
        void(intermediate_result_type) & noexcept,
        void(final_result_type) &&
      > auto&& token)
  {
    // ...
  }
  ``[br]
* Added `operator&&` and `operator||` for `awaitable<>`. The logical operators
  `||` and `&&` have been overloaded for `awaitable<>`, to allow coroutines to
  be trivially awaited in parallel.[br]
  [br]
  When awaited using `&&`, the `co_await` expression waits until both operations
  have completed successfully. As a "short-circuit" evaluation, if one
  operation fails with an exception, the other is immediately cancelled.
  For example:[br]
  ``
  std::tuple<std::size_t, std::size_t> results =
    co_await (
      async_read(socket, input_buffer, use_awaitable)
        && async_write(socket, output_buffer, use_awaitable)
    );
  ``[br]
  When awaited using `||`, the `co_await` expression waits until either
  operation succeeds. As a "short-circuit" evaluation, if one operation
  succeeds without throwing an exception, the other is immediately cancelled.
  For example:[br]
  ``
  std::variant<std::size_t, std::monostate> results =
    co_await (
      async_read(socket, input_buffer, use_awaitable)
        || timer.async_wait(use_awaitable)
    );
  ``[br]
  The operators may be enabled by adding the `#include`:[br]
  ``
  #include <boost/asio/experimental/awaitable_operators.hpp>
  ``[br]
  and then bringing the contents of the `experimental::awaitable_operators`
  namespace into scope:[br]
  ``
  using namespace asio::experimental::awaitable_operators;
  ``[br]
* Added the `experimental::as_tuple` completion token adapter. The `as_tuple`
  completion token adapter can be used to specify that the completion handler
  arguments should be combined into a single tuple argument. The `as_tuple`
  adapter may be used in conjunction with `use_awaitable` and structured
  bindings as follows:[br]
  ``
  auto [e, n] = co_await socket.async_read_some(
      asio::buffer(data), as_tuple(use_awaitable));
  ``[br]
  Alternatively, it may be used as a default completion token like so:[br]
  ``
  using default_token = as_tuple_t<use_awaitable_t<>>;
  using tcp_socket = default_token::as_default_on_t<tcp::socket>;
  // ...
  awaitable<void> do_read(tcp_socket socket)
  {
    // ...
    auto [e, n] = co_await socket.async_read_some(asio::buffer(data));
    // ...
  }
  ``[br]
* Added the `experimental::append` completion token adapter. The `append`
  completion token adapter can be used to pass additional completion handler
  arguments at the end of the completion signature. For example:[br]
  ``
  timer.async_wait(
      asio::experimental::append(
        [](boost::system::error_code ec, int i)
        {
          // ...
        },
      42)
    );

  std::future<int> f = timer.async_wait(
      asio::experimental::append(
        asio::use_future,
        42
      )
    );
  ``[br]
* Added the `experimental::prepend` completion token adapter. The `prepend`
  completion token adapter can be used to pass additional arguments before the
  existing completion handler arguments. For example:[br]
  ``
  timer.async_wait(
      asio::experimental::prepend(
        [](int i, boost::system::error_code ec)
        {
          // ...
        },
      42)
    );

  std::future<std::tuple<int, boost::system::error_code>> f = timer.async_wait(
      asio::experimental::prepend(
        asio::use_future,
        42
      )
    );
  ``[br]
* Added the `experimental::deferred` completion token. The `deferred`
  completion token takes a call to an asynchronous operation's initiating
  function and turns it into a function object that accepts a completion token.
  For example:[br]
  ``
  auto deferred_op =
    timer.async_wait(
      asio::experimental::deferred);
  ...
  std::move(deferred_op)(
      [](boost::system::error_code ec){ ... });
  ``[br]
  or:[br]
  ``
  auto deferred_op =
    timer.async_wait(
      asio::experimental::deferred);
  ...
  std::future<void> =
    std::move(deferred_op)(
      asio::use_future);
  ``[br]
  The deferred token also supports chaining, to create simple compositions:[br]
  ``
  auto deferred_op =
    timer.async_wait(
      asio::experimental::deferred(
        [&](boost::system::error_code ec)
        {
          timer.expires_after(
              std::chrono::seconds(1));

          return timer.async_wait(
              asio::experimental::deferred);
        });
  ...
  std::future<void> = std::move(deferred_op)(asio::use_future);
  ``[br]
* Added the `experimental::parallel_group` class and
  `experimental::make_parallel_group` function. This utility may be used to
  launch work that is performed in parallel, and wait for one or all of the
  operations to complete. A `parallel_group` implements automatic cancellation
  of incomplete operations. For example:[br]
  ``
  experimental::make_parallel_group(
      [&](auto token)
      {
        return stream.async_read_some(asio::buffer(data), token);
      },
      [&](auto token)
      {
        return timer.async_wait(token);
      }
    ).async_wait(
      experimental::wait_for_one(),
      [](
          std::array<std::size_t, 2> completion_order,
          boost::system::error_code ec1, std::size_t n1,
          boost::system::error_code ec2
      )
      {
        // ...
      }
    );
  ``[br]
  The conditions for completion of the group may be specified using one of the
  four provided function objects `wait_for_all`, `wait_for_one`,
  `wait_for_one_success`, and `wait_for_one_error`, or with a custom function.
  The `parallel_group` class can also be combined with `deferred` as
  follows:[br]
  ``
  experimental::make_parallel_group(
      stream.async_read_some(asio::buffer(data), experimental::deferred),
      timer.async_wait(experimental::deferred)
    ).async_wait(
      // ...
    );
  ``[br]
  Note: for maximum flexibility, `parallel_group` does not propagate the
  executor automatically to the operations within the group.
* Added `experimental::promise`. The `promise` type allows eager execution and
  synchronisation of async operations. For example:[br]
  ``
  auto promise = async_read(
      stream, asio::buffer(my_buffer),
      asio::experimental::use_promise);

  ... do other stuff while the read is going on ...

  promise.async_wait( // completion the operation
      [](error_code ec, std::size_t bytes_read)
      {
        ...
      });
  ``[br]
  Promises can be safely disregarded if the result is no longer required.
  Different operations can be combined to either wait for all to complete
  or for one to complete (and cancel the rest). For example, to wait for
  one to complete:[br]
  ``
  auto timeout_promise =
    timer.async_wait(
      asio::experimental::use_promise);

  auto read_promise = async_read(
      stream, asio::buffer(my_buffer),
      asio::experimental::use_promise);

  auto promise =
    asio::experimental::promise<>::race(
      timeout_promise, read_promise);

  promise.async_wait(
      [](std::variant<error_code, std::tuple<error_code, std::size_t>> v)
      {
        if (v.index() == 0) {} //timed out
        else if (v.index() == 1) // completed in time
      });
  ``[br]
  or to wait for all to complete:[br]
  ``
  auto write_promise = async_write(
      stream, asio::buffer(my_write_buffer),
      asio::experimental::use_promise);

  auto read_promise = async_read(
      stream, asio::buffer(my_buffer),
      asio::experimental::use_promise);

  auto promise =
    asio::experimental::promise<>::all(
      write_promise, read_promise);

  promise.async_wait(
      [](std::tuple<error_code, std::size_t> write_result,
        std::tuple<error_code, std::size_t> read_result)
      {
      });
  ``[br]
  Thanks go to Klemens Morgenstern for contributing this feature.
* Added the `experimental::coro` class template. The `coro` type is a C++20
  coroutine primitive for resumable functions, with the ability to combine both
  asynchronous waiting (`co_await`) and yielding (`co_yield`) into a single,
  stateful control flow. For example:[br]
  ``
  #include <boost/asio.hpp>
  #include <boost/asio/experimental/coro.hpp>

  using asio::ip::tcp;

  asio::experimental::coro<std::string> reader(tcp::socket& sock)
  {
    std::string buf;
    while (sock.is_open())
    {
      std::size_t n = co_await asio::async_read_until(
          sock, asio::dynamic_buffer(buf), '\n',
          asio::experimental::use_coro);
      co_yield buf.substr(0, n);
      buf.erase(0, n);
    }
  }

  asio::awaitable<void> consumer(tcp::socket sock)
  {
    auto r = reader(sock);
    auto msg1 = co_await r.async_resume(asio::use_awaitable);
    std::cout << "Message 1: " << msg1.value_or("\n");
    auto msg2 = co_await r.async_resume(asio::use_awaitable);
    std::cout << "Message 2: " << msg2.value_or("\n");
  }

  asio::awaitable<void> listen(tcp::acceptor& acceptor)
  {
    for (;;)
    {
      co_spawn(
          acceptor.get_executor(),
          consumer(co_await acceptor.async_accept(asio::use_awaitable)),
          asio::detached);
    }
  }

  int main()
  {
    asio::io_context ctx;
    tcp::acceptor acceptor(ctx, {tcp::v4(), 54321});
    co_spawn(ctx, listen(acceptor), asio::detached);
    ctx.run();
  }
  ``[br]
  Thanks go to Klemens Morgenstern for contributing this feature.
* Added move assignment to `ssl::stream<>`.
* Changed `co_spawn` to `dispatch` the coroutine's initial step to the executor,
  and to only `post` the completion handler if the coroutine did not otherwise
  perform a context switch (i.e. a `co_await` on an asynchronous operation).
* Enabled additional optimisations for `any_executor` and `any_io_executor`
  when used with asynchronous operations.
* Added the `nodiscard` attribute to `awaitable<>`.
* Increased the number of cached slots in the default recycling allocator.
  This number defaults to 2, but may also be specified by defining the
  `BOOST_ASIO_RECYCLING_ALLOCATOR_CACHE_SIZE` macro.
* Disabled the `std::system_error` message workaround for recent MSVC.
* Changed the default allocator behaviour to respect alignment requirements,
  to support over-aligned types. Requires C++17 or later, or Boost.
* Ensured the result strings are always initialised in reverse name resolution.
* Fixed recursive template instantiation issues in
  `use_awaitable_t::executor_with_default`.
* Fixed the `any_io_executor` equality operators to correctly return a result
  based on the target executor.
* Fixed `strand<>` to avoid using a potentially moved-from executor.
* Ensured [^gcc] tests are not used for [^clang] when detecting compiler
  features.
* Disabled coroutines support for the [^clang] shipped with MSVC.
* Fixed compatibility with recent LibreSSL when `OPENSSL_NO_SSL_INTERN` is
  defined.
* Fixed `posix::basic_stream_descriptor` move operations to work with
  non-defaulted executors.

[heading Asio 1.18.2 / Boost 1.76]

* Added `ip::scope_id_type` type alias.
* Added `ip::port_type` type alias.
* Added `std::hash` specialisations for IP addresses.
* Added `std::hash` specialisations for `ip::basic_endpoint<>`.
* Refactored SFINAE usage to improve compile times.
* Added friendship support to customisation points, and made most customisations private.
* Changed `any_io_executor` to a "strong typedef"-style class.
* Fixed `experimental::as_single` to work with handler hook deprecation.
* Ensured pthread condition variable attributes are cleaned up on all platforms.
* Clarified thread safety notes on sockets and descriptors.
* Ensured `errno` is not overwritten if `socket()` fails on macOS/FreeBSD.
* Fixed work tracking for `io_context` and `thread_pool` executors when move-assigned.
* Ensured internal `call_stack` objects are accessed only from implementation files.
* Fixed I/O object move-assignment to ensure the executor is left in a valid state.
* Fixed detection of compiler support for defaulted template argument on functions with MSVC.
* Prevented the `blocking.always` property from being used with `strand<>`, as it
  did not produce the correct semantics.
* Removed deprecated file [^asio/impl/src.cpp].

[heading Asio 1.18.1 / Boost 1.75]

* Enabled support for UNIX domain sockets on Windows. From Windows 10, UNIX
  domain sockets (a.k.a "local" sockets) are supported on Windows, with the
  exception of the `connect_pair` function (which will fail with an
  operation_not_supported error).
* Added executor-converting construction and assignment to `ip::basic_resolver`.
* Added compatibility between polymorphic executors and the (deprecated) handler
  invocation hook.
* Added the `experimental::as_single` completion token adapter. The `as_single`
  completion token adapter can be used to specify that the completion handler
  arguments should be combined into a single argument. For completion signatures
  with a single parameter, the argument is passed through as-is. For signatures
  with two or more parameters, the arguments are combined into a tuple. The
  `as_single` adapter may be used in conjunction with `use_awaitable` and
  structured bindings as follows:[br]
  ``
  auto [e, n] = co_await socket.async_read_some(
      boost::asio::buffer(data), as_single(use_awaitable));
  ``[br]
  Alternatively, it may be used as a default completion token like so:[br]
  ``
  using default_token = as_single_t<use_awaitable_t<>>;
  using tcp_socket = default_token::as_default_on_t<tcp::socket>;
  // ...
  awaitable<void> do_read(tcp_socket socket)
  {
    // ...
    auto [e, n] = co_await socket.async_read_some(boost::asio::buffer(data));
    // ...
  }
  ``[br]
* Added support for `MSG_NOSIGNAL` on more platforms by using  `_POSIX_VERSION`
  to detect whether it is supported.
* Added the ability to compile using libpthread on Windows.
* Added workarounds for the Intel C++ compiler.
* Added more support for detecting and optimising for handlers that have no
  custom executor.
* Reduced lock contention for timer cancellation on Windows.
* Reinstated a previously removed null-pointer check, as it had a measurable
  impact on performance.
* Fixed the `executor` concept to test for a const-qualified `execute()`.
* Fixed `any_executor` support for builds without RTTI support.
* Fixed the `thread_pool` unit test to work without RTTI support.
* Fixed C++20 coroutines compatibility with clang on Windows.
* Fixed some compatibility issues with Windows Runtime.
* Fixed shadow name warnings caused by addition of `asio::query`.
* Fixed a "logical ‘or’ of equal expressions" warning on linux.
* Fixed a benign switch fallthrough warning.
* Added missing `push/pop_options.hpp` includes.
* Suppressed zero-as-null-pointer-constant warnings.
* Fixed a comma-operator warning.
* Updated the documentation to clarify when the [^select] reactor is used on
  Windows.
* Fixed potential ambiguity caused by `any_executor` comparisons and conversion.
* Added detection of non-experimental C++20 coroutines on MSVC 19.8.
* Fixed compatibility with uClibc.
* Fixed `strand<>` adaptation of Networking TS executors when targeting older
  C++ versions or less conformant compilers.

[heading Asio 1.18.0 / Boost 1.74]

* Added an implementation of the proposed standard executors
	([@http://wg21.link/P0443r13 P0443r13], [@http://wg21.link/P1348r0 P1348r0],
  and [@http://wg21.link/P1393r0 P1393r0]).
* Added support for the proposed standard executors to Asio's I/O facilities:
  * The `io_context::executor_type`, `thread_pool::executor_type`,
    `system_executor`, and `strand` executors now meet the requirements for the
    proposed standard executors. These classes also continue to meet the
    existing requirements for the Networking TS model of executors.
  * All I/O objects, asynchronous operations, and utilities including
    `dispatch`, `post`, `defer`, `get_associated_executor`, `bind_executor`,
    `make_work_guard`, `spawn`, `co_spawn`, `async_compose`, `use_future`,
    etc., can interoperate with both new proposed standard executors, and with
    existing Networking TS executors. The implementation determines at compile
    time which model a particular executor meets; the proposed standard
    executor model is used in preference if both are detected.
  * The `any_io_executor` type alias has been introduced as the new default
    runtime-polymorphic executor for all I/O objects. This type alias points to
    the `execution::any_executor<>` template with a set of supportable
    properties specified for use with I/O. This change may break existing code
    that directly uses the old polymorphic wrapper, `executor`. If required for
    backward compatibility, `BOOST_ASIO_USE_TS_EXECUTOR_AS_DEFAULT` can be
    defined, which changes the `any_io_executor` type alias to instead point to
    the `executor` polymorphic wrapper.
  * Support for the existing Networking TS model of executors can be disabled
    by defining `BOOST_ASIO_NO_TS_EXECUTORS`.
* Added converting move construction and assignment to `basic_waitable_timer`.
  This enables move construction and assignment between different timer
  types, provided the executor types are convertible. For example:[br]
  ``
  basic_waitable_timer<
      clock_type,
      traits_type,
      io_context::executor_type
    > timer1(my_io_context);

  basic_waitable_timer<
      clock_type,
      traits_type,
      any_io_executor // polymorphic wrapper
    > timer2(std::move(timer1));
  ``[br]
* Enabled C++20 coroutine support when using [^gcc] 10.
* Added overloads of `co_spawn` that launch an awaitable. This change allows us
  to write:[br]
  ``
  co_spawn(executor,
      echo(std::move(socket)),
      detached);
  ``[br]
  instead of:[br]
  ``
  co_spawn(executor,
      [socket = std::move(socket)]() mutable
      {
        return echo(std::move(socket));
      },
      detached);
  ``[br]
* Added a new constructor overload to `use_awaitable_t`'s default executor
  adapter, to enable conversion between executor types.
* Added support for using `detached_t` as a default completion token, by
  adding members `as_default_on()` and `as_default_on_t<>`.
* Added a move constructor to `ssl::stream<>`.
* Changed `ssl::stream<>` write operations to linearise gather-write buffer
  sequences.
* Added compile-time detection of the deprecated `asio_handler_invoke` hook.
  This hook was deprecated with the introduction of the Networking TS trait
  `associated_executor` and function `get_associated_executor()`. Compiling
  an application with `BOOST_ASIO_NO_DEPRECATED` will now trigger a compile
  error if any handler implements the `asio_handler_invoke` hook.
* Added compile-time detection of the deprecated `asio_handler_allocate`
  and `asio_handle_deallocate` hooks. These hooks were deprecated with the
  introduction of the Networking TS trait `associated_allocator` and function
  `get_associated_allocator()`. Compiling an application with
  `BOOST_ASIO_NO_DEPRECATED` will now trigger a compile error if any handler
  implements the `asio_handler_allocate` or `asio_handler_deallocate` hooks.
* Implemented a number of performance optimisations, including:
  * Specialising single-buffer operations to use `recv` rather than `recvmsg`,
    `send` rather than `sendmsg`, `read` rather than `readv`, and `write`
    rather than `writev`.
  * Lightening the reference counting overhead of the polymorphic wrapper
    `executor`.
  * Returning from system call operation wrappers as early as possible, and
    only accessing `errno` and error codes when on an error path.
  * Applying additional optimisations if a "native" I/O executor (such as
    `io_context::exeutor_type`) is detected.
* Added source location support to handler tracking. The new
  `BOOST_ASIO_HANDLER_LOCATION((file_name, line, function_name))` macro may be used
  to inform the handler tracking mechanism of a source location. This macro
  declares an object that is placed on the stack. Then, when an asynchronous
  operation is launched with location information, it outputs lines using the
  [*<action>] [^n^m], prior to the [^n*m] line that signifies the beginning
  of the asynchronous operation. For example:
  ``
  @asio|1589423304.861944|>7|ec=system:0,bytes_transferred=5
  @asio|1589423304.861952|7^8|in 'async_write' (./../../../include/asio/impl/write.hpp:330)
  @asio|1589423304.861952|7^8|called from 'do_write' (handler_tracking/async_tcp_echo_server.cpp:62)
  @asio|1589423304.861952|7^8|called from 'operator()' (handler_tracking/async_tcp_echo_server.cpp:51)

  @asio|1589423304.861980|<7|
  ``[br]
  If `std::source_location` or `std::experimental::source_location` are
  available, the `use_awaitable_t` token (when default-constructed or used as a
  default completion token) will also cause handler tracking to output a source
  location for each newly created asynchronous operation. A `use_awaitable_t`
  object may also be explicitly constructed with location information.
* Implemented various improvements to the [^handlerviz.pl] tool.
  * Add nodes for pending handlers at bottom of graph, outlined in red.
  * Display source location in a tooltip on the edge label (for SVG).
  * Use invisible nodes to enforce order to keep related control flow vertical.
* Added the [^handlerlive.pl] tool, which processes handler tracking output to
  produce a list of "live" handlers. Live handlers are those that are
  associated with pending asynchronous operations, as well as handlers that are
  currently executing. For example:
  ``
  cat output.txt | perl handlerlive.pl
  ``
  or:
  ``
  perl handerlive.pl < output.txt
  ``
  or:
  ``
  perl handlerlive.pl output.txt
  ``[br]
* Added the [^handlertree.pl] tool, which filters handler tracking output to
  include only those events in the tree that produced the nominated handlers.
  For example, to filter the output to include only the events associated with
  handlers `123`, `456`, and their predecessors:
  ``
  cat output.txt | perl handlertree.pl 123 456
  ``
  or:
  ``
  perl handlertree.pl 123 456 < output.txt
  ``[br]
  This script may be combined with handerlive.pl and handlerviz.pl to produce a
  graph of the "live" asynchronous operation chains. For example:
  ``
  cat output.txt | \
    perl handlertree.pl `perl handlerlive.pl output.txt` | \
    perl handlerviz.pl | \
    dot -Tsvg > output.svg
  ``[br]
* Added changes for clang-based Embarcadero C++ compilers.
* Fixed a deadlock that can occur when multiple threads concurrently initialise
  the Windows I/O completion port backend.
* Fixed `async_compose` to work with copyable handlers when passed by lvalue.
* Fixed completion signature deduction in `co_spawn`.
* Removed a spurious `Executor` base class from the `executor_binder`
  implementation.
* Various fixes and improvements in the documentation and examples.

[heading Asio 1.16.1 / Boost 1.73]

* Fixed compatibility with C++20 concept syntax.
* Marked the POSIX descriptor classes' move constructors as `noexcept`.
* Added the `ssl::host_name_verification` class, which is a drop-in replacement
  for `ssl::rfc2818_verification`. The `ssl::rfc2818_verification` class has
  been marked as deprecated. As a consequence of this change, SSL support now
  depends on functions that were introduced in OpenSSL 1.0.2.
* Added an `ssl::context` constructor to take ownership of a native handle.
* Changed C++ language version detection with [^gcc] to use `__cplusplus` macro.
* Fixed a work counting issue in the asynchronous resolve operation for
  endpoints.
* Fixed the `strand<>` converting constructors and assignment operators.
* Ensured that resolvers are restarted correctly after a fork.
* Fixed compatibility with the current NetBSD release.
* Removed spurious handler requirement checks in some `async_read` overloads.
* Changed the `ssl::context` class to propagate non-EOF errors from the
  `add_certificate_authority` function.
* Fixed a Windows-specific `thread_pool` destructor hang that occurred when the
  pool had an associated I/O object.
* Changed the [^select] reactor to recreate the "self pipe trick" sockets on
  error. This addresses an issue on some versions of Windows, where these
  sockets are discconected after a system sleep.
* Fixed a compile error in the buffered streams due to the lack of reference
  collapsing in C++98.
* Changed the `priority_scheduler` example to demonstrate calls to `shutdown()`
  and `destroy()`.
* Removed some unnecessary null pointer checks.
* Changed Windows platform detection to recognise TV titles as Windows apps.
* Added some emscripten compatibility patches.
* Fixed a compile error in the `use_awaitable_t::as_default_on` function.
* Changed all uses of the boost.bind placeholders to use the
  `boost::placeholders` namespace.
* Fixed a potential compile error in the `async_compose` implementation due to
  incorrect overload selection.
* Suppressed some non-virtual destructor warnings.
* Various documentation fixes and improvements.

[heading Asio 1.16.0 / Boost 1.72]

* Changed the `async_initiate` helper function to automatically deduce its
  return type. This is enabled for C++11 or later.
* Changed all asynchronous operations to use automatically deduced return
  types. This allows completion token implementations to incorporate the
  asynchronous operation initiation into the initiating function's return type,
  without type erasure. Note that C++14 or later is required to support
  completion tokens that use per-operation return type deduction. For C++11 or
  earlier, a completion token's async_result specialisation must still provide
  the nested typedef `return_type`.
* Introduced three new concepts to support `async_initiate`.
  * `completion_signature<T>`: Checks if `T` is a signature of the form
    `R(Args...)`.
  * `completion_handler_for<T, Signature>`: Checks if `T` is usable as a
    completion handler with the specified signature.
  * `completion_token_for<T, Signature>`: Checks if `T` is a completion token
    that can be used with async_initiate and the specified signature.
  * For backward compatibility with pre-concepts C++, the macros
    `BOOST_ASIO_COMPLETION_SIGNATURE`, `BOOST_ASIO_COMPLETION_HANDLER_FOR`, and
    `BOOST_ASIO_COMPLETION_TOKEN_FOR` are provided. These macros expand to
    `typename` when concepts are unsupported.
* Added the nested template type `rebind_executor` to all I/O object types, as
  a way to generically rebind them to use alternative I/O executors. For
  example:
  ``
  using my_socket_type = tcp::socket::rebind_executor<my_executor_type>::other;
  ``[br]
* Changed the asynchronous operations' initiation function objects to report
  their associated I/O executor via the nested type `executor_type` and member
  function `get_executor()`. Note that the presence of `executor_type` and
  `get_executor()` should be treated as optional, and consequently it may be
  preferable to access them via the `associated_executor` trait and the
  `get_associated_executor()` helper function.
* Added the `default_completion_token` trait, so that every I/O executor type
  now has an associated default completion token type. This trait may be used
  in asynchronous operation declarations as follows:
  ``
  template <
      typename IoObject,
      typename CompletionToken =
        typename default_completion_token<
          typename IoObject::executor_type
        >::type
    >
  auto async_fyz(
      IoObject& io_object,
      CompletionToken&& token =
        typename default_completion_token<
          typename IoObject::executor_type
        >::type{}
    );
  ``[br]
  If not specialised, this trait type is `void`, meaning no default completion
  token type is available for the given I/O executor.
* Specialised the `default_completion_token` trait for the `use_awaitable`
  completion token, so that it may be used as shown in the following example:
  ``
  auto socket = use_awaitable.as_default_on(tcp::socket(my_context));
  // ...
  co_await socket.async_connect(my_endpoint); // Defaults to use_awaitable.
  ``[br]
  In this example, the type of the `socket` object is transformed from
  `tcp::socket` to have an I/O executor with the default completion token set
  to `use_awaitable`. Alternatively, the socket type may be computed directly:
  ``
  using tcp_socket = use_awaitable_t<>::as_default_on_t<tcp::socket>;
  tcp_socket socket(my_context);
  // ...
  co_await socket.async_connect(my_endpoint); // Defaults to use_awaitable.
  ``[br]
* Added missing `async_initiate` to the Windows-specific I/O objects'
  asynchronous operations.
* Ensured that the executor type is propagated to newly accepted sockets.
  When synchronously or asynchronously accepting a new connection, but
  without specifying an executor or execution context, the accept
  operation will now correctly propagate the executor type from the
  acceptor to the socket. For example, if your acceptor type is:
  ``
  basic_socket_acceptor<ip::tcp, my_executor_type>
  ``[br]
  then your accepted socket type will be:
  ``
  basic_stream_socket<ip::tcp, my_executor_type>
  ``[br]
* Changed to require that `Protocol` copy and move operations never throw.
* Changed to require that `Endpoint` default constructor and move operations
  never throw.
* Added the `noexcept` qualifier to protocol accessors.
* Added the `noexcept` qualifier to socket move constructors.
* Fixed issues associated with opening serial ports on Windows:
  * Use the correct constant to initialise the RTS control flag.
  * Specify a default baud rate (9600).
* Fixed a lost "outstanding work count" that can occur when an asynchronous
  accept operation is automatically restarted.

[heading Asio 1.14.1 / Boost 1.71]

* Improved performance slightly by eliminating a redundant move construction
  when completed handlers are dispatched.
* Eliminated a compiler warning by annotating a `case` fall-through in
  the free function `connect()` implementation.
* Fixed the `is_*_buffer_sequence` detection traits for user-defined sequence
  types.
* Fixed some Windows-specific warnings about an incompatible pointer cast when
  obtaining the `CancelIoEx` entry point.
* Changed to automatically set the defaults when opening a serial port on
  Windows.
* Changed the serial port `get_option()` member function to be const.
* Fixed a name hiding issue with the WinRT stream-oriented socket backend's
  `shutdown` function.
* Applied a minor fix to the documentation for `is_dynamic_buffer`.
* Added some support for Haiku OS.
* Added wolfSSL compatability.
* Changed to require C++17 or later for coroutines TS support with clang.
* Fixed a doxygen generation problem in the tutorial.
* Ensured example programs are correctly incorporated into the documentation.

[heading Asio 1.14.0 / Boost 1.70]

* Added custom I/O executor support to I/O objects.
  * All I/O objects now have an additional `Executor` template parameter. This
    template parameter defaults to the `asio::executor` type (the polymorphic
    executor wrapper) but can be used to specify a user-defined executor
    type.
  * I/O objects' constructors and functions that previously took an
    `asio::io_context&` now accept either an `Executor` or a reference to a
    concrete `ExecutionContext` (such as `asio::io_context` or
    `asio::thread_pool`).
  * Note: One potential source of breakage in existing user code is when reusing an
    I/O object's `io_context` for constructing another I/O object, as in:
    ``
    asio::steady_timer my_timer(my_socket.get_executor().context());
    ``[br]
    To fix this, either construct the second I/O object using the first I/O
    object's executor:[br]
    ``
    asio::steady_timer my_timer(my_socket.get_executor());
    ``[br]
    or otherwise explicitly pass the `io_context`:[br]
    ``
    asio::steady_timer my_timer(my_io_context);
    ``[br]
  * The previously deprecated `get_io_context` and `get_io_service`
    member functions have now been removed.
  * The previously deprecated service template parameters, and the
    corresponding classes, have now been removed.
* Added a new `async_result` form with an `initiate` static member function.
  * The `async_result` template now supports a new form:
    ``
    template <typename CompletionToken, typename Signature>
    struct async_result
    {
      typedef /* ... */ return_type;

      template <typename Initiation,
          typename RawCompletionToken,
          typename... Args>
      static return_type initiate(
          Initiation&& initiation,
          RawCompletionToken&& token,
          Args&&... args);
    };
    ``[br]
  * The `initiate` member function must: (a) transform the token into a
    completion handler object `handler`; (b) cause the invocation of the
    function object `initiation` as if by calling
    `std::forward<Initiation>(initiation)(std::move(handler),
    std::forward<Args>(args)...)`. Note that the invocation of `initiation`
    may be deferred (e.g. lazily evaluated), in which case `initiation` and
    `args` must be decay-copied and moved as required.
  * A helper function template `async_initiate` has also been added as a
    wrapper for the invocation of `async_result<>::initiate`. For backward
    compatibility, this function supports both the old and new `async_result`
    forms.
  * The composed operations examples have been updated to use `async_initiate`.
  * The previously deprecated `handler_type` trait and single-argument form of
    `async_result` have now been removed.
* Updated the Coroutines TS support and promoted it to the `asio` namespace.
  * The `awaitable<>`, `co_spawn`, `this_coro`, `detached`, and
    `redirect_error` facilities have been moved from the `asio::experimental`
    namespace to namespace `asio`. As part of this change, the
    `this_coro::token()` awaitable has been superseded by the
    `asio::use_awaitable` completion token.
  * Please note that the `use_awaitable` and `redirect_error` completion tokens
    work only with asynchronous operations that use the new form of
    `async_result` with member function `initiate`. Furthermore, when using
    `use_awaitable`, please be aware that the asynchronous operation is not
    initiated until `co_await` is applied to the `awaitable<>`.
* Added a new `DynamicBuffer_v2` concept which is CopyConstructible.
  * This change adds a new set of type requirements for dynamic buffers,
    `DynamicBuffer_v2`, which supports copy construction. These new type
    requirements enable dynamic buffers to be used as arguments to
    user-defined composed operations, where the same dynamic buffer object
    is used repeatedly for multiple underlying operations. For example:[br]
    ``
      template <typename DynamicBuffer>
      void echo_line(tcp::socket& sock, DynamicBuffer buf)
      {
        n = asio::read_until(sock, buf, '\n');
        asio::write(sock, buf, asio::transfer_exactly(n));
      }
    ``[br]
  * The original `DynamicBuffer` type requirements have been renamed to
    `DynamicBuffer_v1`. These requirements continue to be compatible with the
    Networking TS.
  * New type traits `is_dynamic_buffer_v1` and `is_dynamic_buffer_v2` have been
    added to test for conformance to `DynamicBuffer_v1` and `DynamicBuffer_v2`
    respectively. The existing `is_dynamic_buffer` trait has been retained and
    delegates to `is_dynamic_buffer_v1` (unless `BOOST_ASIO_NO_DYNAMIC_BUFFER_V1` is
    explicitly defined, in which case it delegates to `is_dynamic_buffer_v2`).
  * For convenience, the `dynamic_string_buffer` and `dynamic_vector_buffer`
    classes conform to both `DynamicBuffer_v1` and `DynamicBuffer_v2`
    requirements.
  * When `BOOST_ASIO_NO_DYNAMIC_BUFFER_V1` is defined, all support for
    `DynamicBuffer_v1` types and functions is #ifdef-ed out. Support for using
    `basic_streambuf` with the `read`, `async_read`, `read_until`,
    `async_read_until`, `write`, and `async_write` functions is also disabled
    as a consequence.
  * Note: This change should have no impact on existing source code that simply
    uses dynamic buffers in conjunction with Asio's composed operations.
* Added a new `async_compose` function that simplifies the implementation of
  user-defined asynchronous operations.
* Added a `make_strand` function, which creates a `strand` with a deduced
  `Executor` template argument.
* Relaxed the completion condition type requirements to only require
  move-constructibility rather than copy-constructibility.
* Added a constructor for `local::basic_endpoint` that takes a `string_view`.
* Added the noexcept qualifier to various member functions of the
  `ip::address`, `ip::address_v4`, `ip::address_v6`, `ip::basic_endpoint`, and
  `executor_work_guard` classes.
* Added the noexcept qualifier to the `buffer_sequence_begin` and
  `buffer_sequence_end` functions.
* Added a new `BOOST_ASIO_DISABLE_VISIBILITY` configuration `#define` that allows
  visibility pragmas to be disabled. (Note: If symbols are hidden, extra care
  must be taken to ensure that Asio types are not passed across shared
  library API boundaries.)
* Enabled recycling of the memory used to type-erase a function object with the
  polymorphic executor.
* Changed receive operations to return the correct number of bytes transferred
  when truncation (`error::message_size`) occurs on a datagram-oriented socket.
* Fixed multicast behaviour on QNX by automatically applying `SO_REUSEPORT`
  when the `reuse_address` option is set.
* Added inclusion of `unistd.h` when targeting Haiku OS, to fix feature detection.
* Added the `network_v[46].hpp` headers to the top-level convenience header.
* Fixed calculation of absolute timeout when the backend uses
  `pthread_cond_timedwait`.
* Changed the range-based asynchronous connect operation to deduce the
  `EndpointSequence` iterator type rather than assume the presence of a
  `const_iterator` typedef.
* Fixed `buffer_sequence_begin` and `buffer_sequence_end` to prevent implicit
  conversion. This change addresses an issue where a call to
  `buffer_sequence_begin` or `buffer_sequence_end` could trigger an implicit
  conversion to `const_buffer` or `mutable_buffer`. Whenever this implicit
  conversion occurred, the return value of `buffer_sequence_begin` or
  `buffer_sequence_end` would point to a temporary object.
* Ensured SSL handshake errors are propagated to the peer before the local
  operation completes.
* Suppressed the `eof` error on SSL shutdown as it actually indicates success.
* Added a fallback error code for when we OpenSSL produces an
  `SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL` result without an associated error.
* Changed composed asynchronous read and write operations to move, rather than
  copy, the buffer sequence objects when the composed operation implementation
  is moved.
* Changed to use `<atomic>` when targeting apple/clang/libc++ with recent Xcode
  versions, even for C++03. This fixes a warning about the deprecation of
  `OSMemoryBarrier`.
* Fixed compile errors that occur when using the composed read and write
  operations with MSVC 11.0, by disabling `decltype` support for that compiler.
* Increased the default value of `_WIN32_WINNT` to `0x0601` (Windows 7).
* Fixed `dispatch` documentation to note that it may call the supplied function
  object in the current thread.
* Updated `post` and `defer` documentation to clarify the the distinction
  between them.
* Fixed compilation errors in the read and write composed operations when used
  with MSVC 11.0.
* Fixed a Windows-specific issue where the execution context associated with
  `system_executor` was not being correctly cleaned up on exit.

[heading Asio 1.12.2 / Boost 1.69]

  a 64-bit scope id.
* Added examples showing how to write composed operations.
* Added C++11 versions of the Timeouts, Timers, SOCKS4 and SSL examples.
* Fixed minor issues in documentation and examples.

[heading Asio 1.12.1 / Boost 1.67]

* Added missing const qualifier to `basic_socket_acceptor::get_option`.
* Worked around a parsing error that occurs with some versions of gcc.
* Fixed broken code samples in tutorial.
* Added new experimental features. (Note that "experimental" features may be
  changed without notice in subsequent releases.)
  * Added `experimental::detached` completion token.
  * Added `experimental::redirect_error` completion token.
  * Added `experimental::co_spawn` facility for integration with the coroutines
    technical specification.
* Updated timeout examples to use latest features.
  * Used `asio::steady_timer` rather than `asio::deadline_timer`.
  * Used `asio::dynamic_buffer` rather than `asio::streambuf`.
  * Used timed `asio::io_context::run_for()` function for blocking clients.
  * Added example showing a custom completion token for blocking with timeouts.
* Fixed unit tests to compile when `BOOST_ASIO_NO_DEPRECATED` is defined.
* Changed socket iostreams to use chrono by default, to fix compatibility with
	the Networking TS. Define `BOOST_ASIO_USE_BOOST_DATE_TIME_FOR_SOCKET_IOSTREAM`
	to enable the old Boost.Date_Time interface in `basic_socket_streambuf` and
	`basic_socket_iostream`.
* Updated examples to use chrono rather than Boost.Date_Time.
* Fixed an incorrect member function detector in the `is_dynamic_buffer` trait.
* Fixed an `async_result` incompatibility with deprecated `handler_type`.
* Added a missing move optimisation in the SSL stream implementation.
* Fixed incorrect `basic_resolver_results::value_type` typedef.
* Fixed a compile error with some OpenSSL versions when `SSL_OP_NO_COMPRESSION`
  is defined.
* Changed `add_certificate_authority` to process multiple certificates in a bundle.
* Eliminated deprecation warning with MSVC by using `std::invoke_result` rather
  than `std::result_of`.
* Changed to use `std::string_view` for C++17 or later, and
	`std::experimental::string_view` for C++14. Define the preprocessor macro
	`BOOST_ASIO_DISABLE_STD_STRING_VIEW` to force the use of
	std::experimental::string_view (assuming it is available) when compiling in
	C++17 mode.
* Ensured `DynamicBuffer` template arguments are decayed before using in
  `enable_if` tests.
* Changed documentation to distinguish legacy completion handlers (which are
  still required to be CopyConstructible) from new MoveConstructible handlers.
* Suppressed a discarded return value warning in the buffer debugging support.
* Fixed `basic_yield_context` to work with completion signatures containing
  reference parameters.
* Ensured that stackful coroutines launched using `spawn()` correctly store
  decayed copies of their function and handler arguments.
* Fixed some compatibility issues with Android.
* Added cross-compilation support to Jamfiles.
* Fixed some minor portability issues in examples.

[heading Asio 1.12.0 / Boost 1.66]

* Implemented interface changes to reflect the Networking TS
	([@www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/n4656.pdf N4656]).
	* See the [link boost_asio.net_ts list] of new interfaces and, where
    applicable, the corresponding old interfaces that have been superseded.
	* The service template parameters, and the corresponding classes, are disabled
		by default. For example, instead of `basic_socket<Protocol, SocketService>` we
		now have simply `basic_socket<Protocol>`. The old interface can be enabled by
		defining the `BOOST_ASIO_ENABLE_OLD_SERVICES` macro.
* Removed previously deprecated functions.
* Added support for customised handler tracking.
* Added reactor-related (i.e. descriptor readiness) events to handler tracking.
* Added special [link boost_asio.overview.core.concurrency_hint concurrency
  hint] values that may be used to disable locking on a per `io_context` basis.
* Enabled perfect forwarding for the first `ssl::stream<>` constructor argument.
* Added ability to release ownership of the underlying native socket. (Requires
	Windows 8.1 or later when using the I/O completion port backend.)

[heading Asio 1.10.10 / Boost 1.65]

* Changed to require [^g++] versions >= 4.7 to use standard atomics, to fix
  a linker error when using [^g++] 4.6 ([ticket 13121]).
* Enabled use of `constexpr` and variadic templates with recent MSVC versions.
* Fixed a race condition in the Linux epoll backend, which may occur when a
  socket or descriptor is closed while another thread is blocked on epoll.
* Eliminated use of deprecated `auto_ptr`.
* Fixed misplaced use of `asio_handler_is_continuation` result in reactive
  `async_accept` implementation.
* Changed to use `poll.h` rather than `sys/poll.h` on some modern POSIX
  platforms ([ticket 12419]).
* Fixed MSVC intellisense detection.
* Disabled use of the `__thread` keyword extension for android/clang/x86
  targets.

[heading Asio 1.10.9 / Boost 1.64]

* Added limited support for using regular file descriptors (where I/O
  operations should never fail with `EAGAIN` or `EWOULDBLOCK`) with
  `posix::stream_descriptor`, when using the Linux epoll backend.
* Changed to use `allocator_traits` to rebind allocators in C++11 or later.
* Eliminated a double "construction" issue in the converting move constructors.
* Added new `ssl::context_base` enumerations to enable support for any TLS
  version, and improved consistency of SSL/TLS version handling across OpenSSL

* Suppressed some spurious unused variable warnings issued by [^gcc] ([ticket
  12302]).
* Worked around a new clang warning issued for usage of the comma operator.
* Fixed various header ordering problems.

* Fixed an exception safety issue in the internal hash map implementation.

[heading Asio 1.10.8 / Boost 1.62]

* Added compatibility with OpenSSL 1.1.0 ([ticket 12238]).
* Fixed out-of-bounds iterator use in `asio::connect()` when the
  `connect_condition` returns an end iterator ([ticket 12354]).
* Added a workaround for a move detection problem on MSVC 2015 Update 2
  ([ticket 12115]).
* Changed a workaround that was previously added for broken Windows firewalls
  to only bind to 127.0.0.1 if `getsockname` reports 0.0.0.0 ([ticket
  12406]).
* Added call to `SSL_COMP_free_compression_methods` to fix two memory leaks
  reported at shutdown, for OpenSSL versions >= 1.0.2 and < 1.1.0 ([ticket
  10795]).
* Fixed `use_future` compile error encountered on some standard library
  implementations, by changing `std::allocator<void>` use to a non-void
  template parameter.
* Enabled use of native `getaddrinfo` by default on Apple OSes, rather than
  emulation in terms of `getipnodebyname`.

[heading Asio 1.10.7 / Boost 1.60]

* Added support for Windows 8.1 Store apps.
* Fixed macro multiple definition error on Microsoft Visual Studio 2015
  ([ticket 11539]).
* Changed Asio's SSL wrapper to respect OpenSSL's `OPENSSL_NO_SSL3` feature
  test `#define` ([ticket 11754]).
* Changed Asio's SSL wrapper to use OpenSSL's new `SSL_CTX_clear_chain_certs`
  function, if available.
* Suppressed a clang 3.6+ warning about unused typedefs ([ticket 11767]).
* Regenerated certificates used by SSL examples.
* Fixed buffer sizes passed to `strncat` in the `getaddrinfo` emulation and in
  the SSL wrapper's password handling.
* Changed Windows backend to use non-macro `CreateEventW` rather than

[heading Asio 1.10.6 / Boost 1.58]

* Ensured errors generated by Windows' `ConnectEx` function are mapped to their
  portable equivalents ([ticket 10744]).
* Added new macro `BOOST_ASIO_DISABLE_CONNECTEX` to allow use of `ConnectEx` to
  be explicitly disabled.
* Fixed a race condition in `windows::object_handle` when there are pending
  wait operations on destruction ([ticket 10624]).
* Fixed IPv6 address parsing on FreeBSD, where a trailing scope ID would cause
  conversion to fail with `EINVAL`.
* Worked around shared library visibility issues by ensuring Asio types use
  default visibility ([ticket 9465], [ticket 11070]).
* Changed the SSL wrapper to call the password callback when loading an
  in-memory key ([ticket 10828]).
* Fixed false SSL error reports by ensuring that the SSL error queue is cleared
  prior to each operation.
* Fixed an `ssl::stream<>` bug that may result in spurious 'short read' errors.
* Removed a redundant null pointer check in the SSL engine ([ticket 10088]).
* Added options for disabling TLS v1.1 and v1.2 ([ticket 10690]).
* Removed use of deprecated OpenSSL function `ERR_remove_state`.
* Fixed detection of various C++11 features with Clang ([ticket 8835],
  [ticket 10884]).
* Fixed detection of C++11 `std::addressof` with [^g++] ([ticket 10982]).
* Changed multicast test to treat certain `join_group` failures as non-fatal.
* Decoupled Asio unit tests from Boost.Test ([ticket 11116]).
* Changed the tutorial to use `std::endl` to ensure output is flushed.
* Fixed an unsigned integer overflow reported by Clang's integer sanitizer.
* Added support for move-only return types when using a `yield_context` object
  with asynchronous operations.
* Changed `yield_context` to allow reentrant calls to the completion handler
  from an initiating function.
* Updated detection of Windows Runtime to work with latest Windows SDK.

[heading Asio 1.10.5 / Boost 1.57]

* Fixed the [^kqueue] reactor so that it works on FreeBSD ([ticket 10606]).
* Fixed an issue in the [^kqueue] reactor which resulted in spinning when using
  serial ports on Mac OS ([ticket 10496]).
* Fixed [^kqueue] reactor support for read-only file descriptors
  ([ticket 10367]).
* Fixed a compile error when using the [^/dev/poll] reactor ([ticket 10350],
  [ticket 10572]).
* Changed the Windows backend to use `WSASocketW`, as `WSASocketA` has been
  deprecated ([ticket 10534]).
* Fixed some warnings reported by Visual C++ 2013 ([ticket 10376]).
* Fixed integer type used in the WinRT version of the byte-order conversion
  functions ([ticket 10539]).
* Changed documentation to indicate that `use_future` and `spawn()` are not
  made available when including the `asio.hpp` convenience header ([ticket
  10567]).
* Explicitly marked `asio::strand` as deprecated. Use
  `asio::io_service::strand` instead.

[heading Asio 1.10.4 / Boost 1.56]

* Stopped using certain Winsock functions that are marked as deprecated in the
  latest Visual C++ and Windows SDK.
* Fixed a shadow variable warning on Windows.
* Fixed a regression in the [^kqueue] backend that was introduced in Asio
  1.10.2.
* Added a workaround for building the unit tests with [^gcc] on AIX.

[heading Asio 1.10.3]

* Worked around a [^gcc] problem to do with anonymous enums ([ticket 10042]).
* Reverted the Windows `HANDLE` backend change to ignore `ERROR_MORE_DATA`.
  Instead, the error will be propagated as with any other (i.e. in an
  `error_code` or thrown as a `system_error`), and the number of bytes
  transferred will be returned. For code that needs to handle partial messages,
  the `error_code` overload should be used ([ticket 10034]).
* Fixed an off-by-one error in the `signal_set` implementation's signal
  number check ([ticket 9324]).
* Changed the Windows IOCP backend to not assume that
  `SO_UPDATE_CONNECT_CONTEXT` is defined ([ticket 10016]).
* Fixed a Windows-specific issue, introduced in Asio 1.10.2, by using
  `VerifyVersionInfo` rather than `GetVersionEx`, as `GetVersionEx` has been
  deprecated.
* Changed to use SSE2 intrinsics rather than inline assembly, to allow the
  Cray compiler to work.

[heading Asio 1.10.2]

* Fixed `asio::spawn()` to work correctly with new Boost.Coroutine interface
  ([ticket 9442], [ticket 9928]).
* Ensured that incomplete `asio::spawn()` coroutines are correctly unwound when
  cleaned up by the `io_service` destructor ([ticket 9731]).
* Fixed delegation of continuation hook for handlers produced by
  `io_service::wrap()` and `strand::wrap()` ([ticket 9741]).
* Changed the Windows I/O completion port backend to use `ConnectEx`, if
  available, for connection-oriented IP sockets.
* Changed the `io_service` backend for non-Windows (and non-IOCP Windows)
  platforms to use a single condition variable per `io_service` instance.
  This addresses a potential race condition when `run_one()` is used from
  multiple threads.
* Prevented integer overflow when computing timeouts based on some
  `boost::chrono` and `std::chrono` clocks ([ticket 9662], [ticket 9778]).
* Made further changes to `EV_CLEAR` handling in the kqueue backend, to address
  other cases where the `close()` system call may hang on Mac OS X.
* Fixed infinite recursion in implementation of
  `resolver_query_base::flags::operator~` ([ticket 9548]).
* Made the `select` reactor more efficient on Windows for large numbers of
  sockets ([ticket 9528]).
* Fixed a Windows-specific type-aliasing issue reported by [^gcc] ([ticket
  9550]).
* Prevented execution of compile-time-only buffer test to avoid triggering an
  address sanitiser warning ([ticket 8295]).
* Disabled the `GetQueuedCompletionStatus` timeout workaround on recent
  versions of Windows.
* Added support for string-based scope IDs when using link-local multicast
  addresses.
* Changed IPv6 multicast group join to use the address's scope ID as the
  interface, if an interface is not explicitly specified.
* Fixed multicast test failure on Mac OS X and the BSDs by using a link-local
  multicast address.
* Various minor documentation improvements ([ticket 8295], [ticket 9605],
  [ticket 9771]).

[heading Asio 1.10.1 / Boost 1.55]

* Implemented a limited port to Windows Runtime. This support requires that the
  language extensions be enabled. Due to the restricted facilities exposed by
  the Windows Runtime API, the port also comes with the following caveats:
  * The core facilities such as the `io_service`, `strand`, buffers, composed
    operations, timers, etc., should all work as normal.
  * For sockets, only client-side TCP is supported.
  * Explicit binding of a client-side TCP socket is not supported.
  * The `cancel()` function is not supported for sockets. Asynchronous
    operations may only be cancelled by closing the socket.
  * Operations that use `null_buffers` are not supported.
  * Only `tcp::no_delay` and `socket_base::keep_alive` options are supported.
  * Resolvers do not support service names, only numbers. I.e. you must
    use "80" rather than "http".
  * Most resolver query flags have no effect.
* Fixed a regression (introduced in Boost 1.54) where, on some platforms, errors
  from `async_connect` were not correctly propagated through to the completion
  handler ([ticket 8795]).
* Fixed a Windows-specific regression (introduced in Boost 1.54) that occurs
  when multiple threads are running an `io_service`. When the bug occurs, the
  result of an asynchronous operation (error and bytes tranferred) is
  incorrectly discarded and zero values used instead. For TCP sockets this
  results in spurious end-of-file notifications ([ticket 8933]).
* Fixed a bug in handler tracking, where it was not correctly printing out some
  handler IDs ([ticket 8808]).
* Fixed the comparison used to test for successful synchronous accept
  operations so that it works correctly with unsigned socket descriptors
  ([ticket 8752]).
* Ensured the signal number is correctly passed to the completion handler when
  starting an `async_wait` on a signal that is already raised ([ticket 8738]).
* Suppressed a g++ 4.8+ warning about unused typedefs ([ticket 8980]).
* Enabled the move optimisation for handlers that use the default invocation
  hook ([ticket 8624]).
* Clarified that programs must not issue overlapping `async_write_at`
  operations ([ticket 8669]).
* Changed the Windows `HANDLE` backend to treat `ERROR_MORE_DATA` as a
  non-fatal error when returned by `GetOverlappedResult` for a synchronous
  read ([ticket 8722]).
* Visual C++ language extensions use `generic` as a keyword. Added a
  workaround that renames the namespace to `cpp_generic` when those language
  extensions are in effect.
* Fixed some asynchronous operations that missed out on getting `async_result`
  support in Boost 1.54. In particular, the buffered stream templates have been
  updated so that they adhere to current handler patterns ([ticket 9000],
  [ticket 9001]).
* Enabled move support for Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 ([ticket 8959]).
* Added `use_future` support for Microsoft Visual Studio 2012.
* Removed a use of `std::min` in the Windows IOCP backend to avoid a
  dependency on the `<algorithm>` header ([ticket 8758]).
* Eliminated some unnecessary handler copies.
* Fixed support for older versions of OpenSSL that do not provide the
  `SSL_CTX_clear_options` function ([ticket 9273]).
* Fixed various minor and cosmetic issues in code and documentation
  (including [ticket 8347], [ticket 8950], [ticket 8953], [ticket 8965],
  [ticket 8997], [ticket 9230]).

[heading Asio 1.10.0 / Boost 1.54]

* Added new traits classes, `handler_type` and `async_result`, that allow the
  customisation of the return type of an initiating function.
* Added the `asio::spawn()` function, a high-level wrapper for running
  stackful coroutines, based on the Boost.Coroutine library. The `spawn()`
  function enables programs to implement asynchronous logic in a synchronous
  manner. For example: `size_t n = my_socket.async_read_some(my_buffer, yield);`.
  For further information, see [link boost_asio.overview.core.spawn Stackful
  Coroutines].
* Added the `asio::use_future` special value, which provides first-class
  support for returning a C++11 `std::future` from an asynchronous
  operation's initiating function. For example:
  `future<size_t> = my_socket.async_read_some(my_buffer, asio::use_future);`.
  For further information, see [link boost_asio.overview.cpp2011.futures C++
  2011 Support - Futures].
* Promoted the stackless coroutine class and macros to be part of Asio's
  documented interface, rather than part of the HTTP server 4 example.
  For further information, see [link boost_asio.overview.core.coroutine
  Stackless Coroutines].
* Added a new handler hook called `asio_handler_is_continuation`.
  Asynchronous operations may represent a continuation of the asynchronous
  control flow associated with the current executing handler. The
  `asio_handler_is_continuation` hook can be customised to return `true` if
  this is the case, and Asio's implementation can use this knowledge to
  optimise scheduling of the new handler. To cover common cases, Asio
  customises the hook for strands, `spawn()` and composed asynchronous
  operations.
* Added four new generic protocol classes, `generic::datagram_protocol`,
  `generic::raw_protocol`, `generic::seq_packet_protocol` and
  `generic::stream_protocol`, which implement the `Protocol` type
  requirements, but allow the user to specify the address family (e.g.
  `AF_INET`) and protocol type (e.g. `IPPROTO_TCP`) at runtime.
  For further information, see [link
  boost_asio.overview.networking.other_protocols Support for Other Protocols].
* Added C++11 move constructors that allow the conversion of a socket (or
  acceptor) into a more generic type. For example, an `ip::tcp::socket` can
  be converted into a `generic::stream_protocol::socket` via move
  construction.
  For further information, see [link
  boost_asio.overview.networking.other_protocols Support for Other Protocols].
* Extended the `basic_socket_acceptor<>`'s `accept()` and `async_accept()`
  functions to allow a new connection to be accepted directly into a socket
  of a more generic type. For example, an `ip::tcp::acceptor` can be used to
  accept into a `generic::stream_protocol::socket` object.
  For further information, see [link
  boost_asio.overview.networking.other_protocols Support for Other Protocols].
* Moved existing examples into a C++03-specific directory, and added a new
  directory for C++11-specific examples. A limited subset of the C++03
  examples have been converted to their C++11 equivalents.
* Various SSL enhancements. Thanks go to Nick Jones, on whose work these changes
  are based.
  * Added support for SSL handshakes with re-use of data already read from
    the wire. New overloads of the `ssl::stream<>` class's `handshake()` and
    `async_handshake()` functions have been added. These accept a
    `ConstBufferSequence` to be used as initial input to the ssl engine for
    the handshake procedure.
  * Added support for creation of TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 `ssl::context` objects.
  * Added a `set_verify_depth()` function to the `ssl::context` and
    `ssl::stream<>` classes.
  * Added the ability to load SSL certificate and key data from memory
    buffers. New functions, `add_certificate_authority()`,
    `use_certificate()`, `use_certificate_chain()`, `use_private_key()`,
    `use_rsa_private_key()` and `use_tmp_dh()`, have been added to the
    `ssl::context` class.
  * Changed `ssl::context` to automatically disable SSL compression by
    default. To enable, use the new `ssl::context::clear_options()` function,
    as in `my_context.clear_options(ssl::context::no_compression)`.
* Fixed a potential deadlock in `signal_set` implementation.
* Fixed an error in acceptor example in documentation [ticket 8421].
* Fixed copy-paste errors in waitable timer documentation [ticket 8602].
* Added assertions to satisfy some code analysis tools [ticket 7739].
* Fixed a malformed `#warning` directive [ticket 7939].
* Fixed a potential data race in the Linux `epoll` implementation.
* Fixed a Windows-specific bug, where certain operations might generate an
  `error_code` with an invalid (i.e. `NULL`) `error_category` [ticket 8613].
* Fixed `basic_waitable_timer`'s underlying implementation so that it can
  handle any `time_point` value without overflowing the intermediate duration
  objects.
* Fixed a problem with lost thread wakeups that can occur when making
  concurrent calls to `run()` and `poll()` on the same `io_service` object
  [ticket 8354].
* Fixed implementation of asynchronous connect operation so that it can cope
  with spurious readiness notifications from the reactor [ticket 7961].
* Fixed a memory leak in the `ssl::rfc2818_verification` class.
* Added a mechanism for disabling automatic Winsock initialisation [ticket
  3605]. See the header file [^boost/asio/detail/winsock_init.hpp] for details.

[heading Asio 1.8.3 / Boost 1.53]

* Fixed some 64-to-32-bit conversion warnings ([ticket 7459]).
* Fixed some small errors in documentation and comments ([ticket 7761]).
* Fixed an error in the example embedded in `basic_socket::get_option`'s
  documentation ([ticket 7562]).
* Changed to use `long` rather than `int` for SSL_CTX options, to match OpenSSL
  ([ticket 7209]).
* Changed to use `_snwprintf` to address a compile error due to the changed
  `swprintf` signature in recent versions of MinGW ([ticket 7373]).
* Fixed a deadlock that can occur on Windows when shutting down a pool of
  `io_service` threads due to running out of work ([ticket 7552]).
* Enabled the `noexcept` qualifier for error categories ([ticket 7797]).
* Changed UNIX domain socket example to treat errors from `accept` as non-fatal
  ([ticket 7488]).
* Added a small block recycling optimisation to improve default memory
  allocation behaviour.

[heading Asio 1.8.2 / Boost 1.51]

* Fixed an incompatibility between `ip::tcp::iostream` and C++11
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/7162 #7162]).
* Decorated GCC attribute names with underscores to prevent interaction
  with user-defined macros
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6415 #6415]).
* Added missing `#include <cctype>`, needed for some versions of MinGW.
* Changed to use [^gcc]'s atomic builtins on ARM CPUs, when available
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/7140 #7140]).
* Changed strand destruction to be a no-op, to allow strand objects to be
  destroyed after their associated `io_service` has been destroyed.
* Added support for some newer versions of glibc which provide the
  `epoll_create1()` function but always fail with `ENOSYS`
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/7012 #7012]).
* Changed the SSL implementation to throw an exception if SSL engine
  initialisation fails
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6303 #6303]).
* Fixed another regression in `buffered_write_stream`
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6310 #6310]).
* Implemented various minor performance improvements, primarily targeted at
  Linux x86 and x86-64 platforms.

[heading Asio 1.8.1 / Boost 1.50]

* Changed the `epoll_reactor` backend to do lazy registration for `EPOLLOUT`
  events.
* Fixed the `epoll_reactor` handling of out-of-band data, which was broken by
  an incomplete fix in the last release.
* Changed Asio's SSL wrapper to respect OpenSSL's `OPENSSL_NO_ENGINE` feature
  test `#define` ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6432 #6432]).
* Fixed `windows::object_handle` so that it works with Windows compilers that
  support C++11 move semantics (such as [^g++]).
* Improved the performance of strand rescheduling.
* Added support for [^g++] 4.7 when compiling in C++11 mode
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6620 #6620]).
* Fixed a problem where `signal_set` handlers were not being delivered when
  the `io_service` was constructed with a `concurrency_hint` of 1
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6657 #6657]).

[heading Asio 1.8.0 / Boost 1.49]

* Added a new class template `basic_waitable_timer` based around the C++11 clock
  type requirements. It may be used with the clocks from the C++11 `<chrono>`
  library facility or, if those are not available, Boost.Chrono. The typedefs
  `high_resolution_timer`, `steady_timer` and `system_timer` may be used to
  create timer objects for the standard clock types.
* Added a new `windows::object_handle` class for performing waits on Windows
  kernel objects. Thanks go to Boris Schaeling for contributing substantially
  to the development of this feature.
* On Linux, `connect()` can return EAGAIN in certain circumstances. Remapped
  this to another error so that it doesn't look like a non-blocking operation
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6048 #6048]).
* Fixed a compile error on NetBSD
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6098 #6098]).
* Fixed deadlock on Mac OS X
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6275 #6275]).
* Fixed a regression in `buffered_write_stream`
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6310 #6310]).
* Fixed a non-paged pool "leak" on Windows when an `io_service` is repeatedly
  run without anything to do
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6321 #6321]).
* Reverted earlier change to allow some speculative operations to be performed
  without holding the lock, as it introduced a race condition in some
  multithreaded scenarios.
* Fixed a bug where the second buffer in an array of two buffers may be ignored
  if the first buffer is empty.

[heading Asio 1.6.1 / Boost 1.48]

* Implemented various performance improvements, including:
  * Using thread-local operation queues in single-threaded use cases (i.e. when
    `concurrency_hint` is 1) to eliminate a lock/unlock pair. 
  * Allowing some `epoll_reactor` speculative operations to be performed
    without holding the lock. 
  * Improving locality of reference by performing an `epoll_reactor`'s I/O
    operation immediately before the corresponding handler is called. This also
    improves scalability across CPUs when multiple threads are running the
    `io_service`. 
  * Specialising asynchronous read and write operations for buffer sequences
    that are arrays (`boost::array` or `std::array`) of exactly two buffers.
* Fixed a compile error in the regex overload of `async_read_until`
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5688 #5688]).
* Fixed a Windows-specific compile error by explicitly specifying the
  `signal()` function from the global namespace
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5722 #5722]).
* Changed the `deadline_timer` implementation so that it does not read the
  clock unless the timer heap is non-empty.
* Changed the SSL stream's buffers' sizes so that they are large enough to hold
  a complete TLS record ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5854 #5854]).
* Fixed the behaviour of the synchronous `null_buffers` operations so that they
  obey the user's non-blocking setting
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5756 #5756]).
* Changed to set the size of the select `fd_set` at runtime when using Windows.
* Disabled an MSVC warning due to const qualifier being applied to function type.
* Fixed a crash that occurs when using the Intel C++ compiler
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5763 #5763]).
* Changed the initialisation of the OpenSSL library so that it supports all
  available algorithms.
* Fixed the SSL error mapping used when the session is gracefully shut down.
* Added some latency test programs.
* Clarified that a read operation ends when the buffer is full
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5999 #5999]).
* Fixed an exception safety issue in `epoll_reactor` initialisation
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6006 #6006]).
* Made the number of strand implementations configurable by defining
  `BOOST_ASIO_STRAND_IMPLEMENTATIONS` to the desired number.
* Added support for a new `BOOST_ASIO_ENABLE_SEQUENTIAL_STRAND_ALLOCATION` flag
  which switches the allocation of strand implementations to use a round-robin
  approach rather than hashing.
* Fixed potential strand starvation issue that can occur when `strand.post()`
  is used.

[heading Asio 1.6.0 / Boost 1.47]

* Added support for signal handling, using a new class called `signal_set`.
  Programs may add one or more signals to the set, and then perform an
  `async_wait()` operation. The specified handler will be called when one of
  the signals occurs. The same signal number may be registered with multiple
  `signal_set` objects, however the signal number must be used only with Asio.
  Addresses [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2879 #2879].
* Added handler tracking, a new debugging aid. When enabled by defining
  `BOOST_ASIO_ENABLE_HANDLER_TRACKING`, Asio writes debugging output to the
  standard error stream. The output records asynchronous operations and the
  relationships between their handlers. It may be post-processed using the
  included [^handlerviz.pl] tool to create a visual representation of the
  handlers (requires GraphViz).
* Added support for timeouts on socket iostreams, such as `ip::tcp::iostream`.
  A timeout is set by calling `expires_at()` or `expires_from_now()` to
  establish a deadline. Any socket operations which occur past the deadline
  will put the iostream into a bad state.
* Added a new `error()` member function to socket iostreams, for retrieving the
  error code from the most recent system call.
* Added a new `basic_deadline_timer::cancel_one()` function. This function lets
  you cancel a single waiting handler on a timer. Handlers are cancelled in
  FIFO order.
* Added a new `transfer_exactly()` completion condition. This can be used to
  send or receive a specified number of bytes even if the total size of the
  buffer (or buffer sequence) is larger.
* Added new free functions `connect()` and `async_connect()`. These operations
  try each endpoint in a list until the socket is successfully connected, and
  are useful for creating TCP clients that work with both IPv4 and IPv6.
* Extended the `buffer_size()` function so that it works for buffer sequences
  in addition to individual buffers.
* Added a new `buffer_copy()` function that can be used to copy the raw bytes
  between individual buffers and buffer sequences.
* Added new non-throwing overloads of `read()`, `read_at()`, `write()` and
  `write_at()` that do not require a completion condition.
* Added friendlier compiler errors for when a completion handler does not meet
  the necessary type requirements. When C++0x is available (currently supported
  for [^g++] 4.5 or later, and MSVC 10), `static_assert` is also used to
  generate an informative error message. This checking may be disabled by
  defining `BOOST_ASIO_DISABLE_HANDLER_TYPE_REQUIREMENTS`.
* Added a new, completely rewritten SSL implementation. The new implementation
  compiles faster, shows substantially improved performance, and supports
  custom memory allocation and handler invocation. It includes new API features
  such as certificate verification callbacks and has improved error reporting.
  The new implementation is source-compatible with the old for most uses.
  However, if necessary, the old implementation may still be used by defining
  `BOOST_ASIO_ENABLE_OLD_SSL`.
  Addresses [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3702 #3702],
  [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3958 #3958].
* Changed the separate compilation support such that, to use Asio's SSL
  capabilities, you should also include `boost/asio/ssl/impl/src.hpp` in one
  source file in your program.
* Changed the SSL implementation to support build environments where SSL v2 is
  explicitly disabled ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5453 #5453]).
* Made the `is_loopback()`, `is_unspecified()` and `is_multicast()` functions
  consistently available across the `ip::address`, `ip::address_v4` and
  `ip::address_v6` classes
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3939 #3939]).
* Added new `non_blocking()` functions for managing the non-blocking behaviour
  of a socket or descriptor. The `io_control()` commands named `non_blocking_io`
  are now deprecated in favour of these new functions.
* Added new `native_non_blocking()` functions for managing the non-blocking
  mode of the underlying socket or descriptor. These functions are intended to
  allow the encapsulation of arbitrary non-blocking system calls as
  asynchronous operations, in a way that is transparent to the user of the
  socket object. The functions have no effect on the behaviour of the
  synchronous operations of the socket or descriptor.
* Added the `io_control()` member function for socket acceptors
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3297 #3297]).
* Added a `release()` member function to posix descriptors. This function
  releases ownership of the underlying native descriptor to the caller.
  Addresses [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3900 #3900].
* Added support for sequenced packet sockets (`SOCK_SEQPACKET`).
* Added a new `io_service::stopped()` function that can be used to determine
  whether the `io_service` has stopped (i.e. a `reset()` call is needed prior
  to any further calls to `run()`, `run_one()`, `poll()` or `poll_one()`).
* For consistency with the C++0x standard library, deprecated the `native_type`
  typedefs in favour of `native_handle_type`, and the `native()` member
  functions in favour of `native_handle()`.
* Added support for C++0x move construction and assignment to sockets, serial
  ports, POSIX descriptors and Windows handles.
* Reduced the copying of handler function objects.
* Added support for C++0x move construction to further reduce (and in some
  cases eliminate) copying of handler objects.
* Added support for the `fork()` system call. Programs that use `fork()` must
  call `io_service.notify_fork()` at the appropriate times. Two new examples
  have been added showing how to use this feature. Addresses
  [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3238 #3238],
  [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4162 #4162].
* Cleaned up the handling of errors reported by the `close()` system call. In
  particular, assume that most operating systems won't have `close()` fail with
  `EWOULDBLOCK`, but if it does then set the blocking mode and restart the call.
  If any other error occurs, assume the descriptor is closed. Addresses
  [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3307 #3307].
* Added new `asio::buffer()` overloads for `std::array`, when available.
* Changed the implementation to use the C++0x standard library templates
  `array`, `shared_ptr`, `weak_ptr` and `atomic` when they are available,
  rather than the Boost equivalents.
* Use C++0x variadic templates when available, rather than generating function
  overloads using Boost.Preprocessor.
* Changed exception reporting to include the function name in exception `what()`
  messages.
* Fixed insufficient initialisers warning with MinGW.
* Changed the `shutdown_service()` member functions to be private.
* Added archetypes for testing socket option functions.
* Changed the Boost.Asio examples so that they don't use Boost.Thread's
  convenience header. Use the header file that is specifically for the
  boost::thread class instead.
* Removed the dependency on OS-provided macros for the well-known IPv4 and IPv6
  addresses. This should eliminate annoying "missing braces around initializer"
  warnings ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3741 #3741]).
* Reduced the size of `ip::basic_endpoint<>` objects (such as
  `ip::tcp::endpoint` and `ip::udp::endpoint`).
* Changed the reactor backends to assume that any descriptors or sockets added
  using `assign()` may have been `dup()`-ed, and so require explicit
  deregistration from the reactor
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4971 #4971]).
* Removed the deprecated member functions named `io_service()`. The
  `get_io_service()` member functions should be used instead.
* Removed the deprecated typedefs `resolver_query` and `resolver_iterator` from
  the `ip::tcp`, `ip::udp` and `ip::icmp` classes.
* Modified the `buffers_iterator<>` and `ip::basic_resolver_iterator` classes
  so that the value_type typedefs are non-const byte types.
* Fixed warnings reported by g++'s [^-Wshadow] compiler option
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3905 #3905]).
* Added an explicit cast to convert the `FIONBIO` constant to int, to suppress
  a compiler warning on some platforms
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5128 #5128]).
* Changed most examples to treat a failure by an accept operation as non-fatal
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5124 #5124]).
* Fixed an error in the [^tick_count_timer] example by making the duration type
  signed. Previously, a wait on an already-passed deadline would not return for
  a very long time ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5418 #5418]).

[heading Asio 1.4.9 / Boost 1.46.1]

* `EV_ONESHOT` seems to cause problems on some versions of Mac OS X, with the
  `io_service` destructor getting stuck inside the `close()` system call.
  Changed the kqueue backend to use `EV_CLEAR` instead
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5021 #5021]).
* Fixed compile failures with some versions of [^g++] due to the use of
  anonymous enums ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4883 #4883]).
* Fixed a bug on kqueue-based platforms, where some system calls that
  repeatedly fail with `EWOULDBLOCK` are not correctly re-registered with
  kqueue.
* Changed `asio::streambuf` to ensure that its internal pointers are updated
  correctly after the data has been modified using `std::streambuf` member
  functions.
* Fixed a bug that prevented the linger socket option from working on platforms
  other than Windows.

[heading Asio 1.4.8 / Boost 1.46]

* Fixed an integer overflow problem that occurs when
  `ip::address_v4::broadcast()` is used on 64-bit platforms.
* Fixed a problem on older Linux kernels (where epoll is used without timerfd
  support) that prevents timely delivery of deadline_timer handlers, after the
  program has been running for some time
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5045 #5045]).

[heading Asio 1.4.7 / Boost 1.45]

* Fixed a problem on kqueue-based platforms where a `deadline_timer` may
  never fire if the `io_service` is running in a background thread
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4568 #4568]).
* Fixed a const-correctness issue that prevented valid uses of
  `has_service<>` from compiling
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4638 #4638]).
* Fixed MinGW cross-compilation
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4491 #4491]).
* Removed dependency on deprecated Boost.System functions
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4672 #4672]).
* Ensured `close()`\/`closesocket()` failures are correctly propagated
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4573 #4573]).
* Added a check for errors returned by `InitializeCriticalSectionAndSpinCount`
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4574 #4574]).
* Added support for hardware flow control on QNX
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4625 #4625]).
* Always use `pselect()` on HP-UX, if it is available
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4578 #4578]).
* Ensured handler arguments are passed as lvalues
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4744 #4744]).
* Fixed Windows build when thread support is disabled
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4680 #4680]).
* Fixed a Windows-specific problem where `deadline_timer` objects with expiry
  times set more than 5 minutes in the future may never expire
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4745 #4745]).
* Fixed the `resolver` backend on BSD platforms so that an empty service name
  resolves to port number `0`, as per the documentation
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4690 #4690]).
* Fixed read operations so that they do not accept buffer sequences of type
  `const_buffers_1` ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4746 #4746]).
* Redefined `Protocol` and `id` to avoid clashing with Objective-C++ keywords
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4191 #4191]).
* Fixed a `vector` reallocation performance issue that can occur when there are
  many active `deadline_timer` objects
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4780 #4780]).
* Fixed the kqueue backend so that it compiles on NetBSD
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4662 #4662]).
* Fixed the socket `io_control()` implementation on 64-bit Mac OS X and BSD
  platforms ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4782 #4782]).
* Fixed a Windows-specific problem where failures from `accept()` are
  incorrectly treated as successes
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4859 #4859]).
* Deprecated the separate compilation header `<boost/asio/impl/src.cpp>` in
  favour of `<boost/asio/impl/src.hpp>`
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4560 #4560]).

[heading Asio 1.4.6 / Boost 1.44]

* Reduced compile times. (Note that some programs may need to add additional
  `#include`s, e.g. if the program uses `boost::array` but does not explicitly
  include `<boost/array.hpp>`.)
* Reduced the size of generated code.
* Refactored `deadline_timer` implementation to improve performance.
* Improved multiprocessor scalability on Windows by using a dedicated hidden
  thread to wait for timers.
* Improved performance of `asio::streambuf` with `async_read()` and 
  `async_read_until()`. These read operations now use the existing capacity of
  the `streambuf` when reading, rather than limiting the read to 512 bytes.
* Added optional separate compilation. To enable, add
  `#include <boost/asio/impl/src.cpp>` to one source file in a program, then
  build the program with `BOOST_ASIO_SEPARATE_COMPILATION` defined in the
  project\/compiler settings. Alternatively, `BOOST_ASIO_DYN_LINK` may be
  defined to build a separately-compiled Asio as part of a shared library.
* Added new macro `BOOST_ASIO_DISABLE_FENCED_BLOCK` to permit the disabling of
  memory fences around completion handlers, even if thread support is enabled.
* Reworked timeout examples to better illustrate typical use cases.
* Ensured that handler arguments are passed as `const` types.
* Fixed incorrect parameter order in `null_buffers` variant of `async_send_to`
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4170 #4170]).
* Ensured `unsigned char` is used with `isdigit` in `getaddrinfo` emulation
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4201 #4201]).
* Fixed handling of very small but non-zero timeouts
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4205 #4205]).
* Fixed crash that occurred when an empty buffer sequence was passed to a
  composed read or write operation.
* Added missing `operator+` overload in `buffers_iterator`
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4382 #4382]).
* Implemented cancellation of `null_buffers` operations on Windows.

[heading Asio 1.4.5 / Boost 1.43]

* Improved performance.
* Reduced compile times.
* Reduced the size of generated code.
* Extended the guarantee that background threads don't call user code to all
  asynchronous operations
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3923 #3923]).
* Changed to use edge-triggered epoll on Linux.
* Changed to use `timerfd` for dispatching timers on Linux, when available.
* Changed to use one-shot notifications with kqueue on Mac OS X and BSD
  platforms.
* Added a bitmask type `ip::resolver_query_base::flags` as per the TR2 proposal.
  This type prevents implicit conversion from `int` to `flags`, allowing the
  compiler to catch cases where users incorrectly pass a numeric port number as
  the service name.
* Added `#define NOMINMAX` for all Windows compilers. Users can define
  `BOOST_ASIO_NO_NOMINMAX` to suppress this definition
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3901 #3901]).
* Fixed a bug where 0-byte asynchronous reads were incorrectly passing an
  `error::eof` result to the completion handler
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4023 #4023]).
* Changed the `io_control()` member functions to always call `ioctl` on the
  underlying descriptor when modifying blocking mode
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3307 #3307]).
* Changed the resolver implementation to longer require the typedefs
  `InternetProtocol::resolver_query` and `InternetProtocol::resolver_iterator`,
  as neither typedef is part of the documented `InternetProtocol` requirements.
  The corresponding typedefs in the `ip::tcp`, `ip::udp` and `ip::icmp` classes
  have been deprecated.
* Fixed out-of-band handling for reactors not based on `select()`.
* Added new `BOOST_ASIO_DISABLE_THREADS` macro that allows Asio's threading
  support to be independently disabled.
* Minor documentation improvements.

[heading Asio 1.4.4 / Boost 1.42]

* Added a new HTTP Server 4 example illustrating the use of stackless coroutines
  with Asio.
* Changed handler allocation and invocation to use `boost::addressof` to get the
  address of handler objects, rather than applying `operator&` directly
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2977 #2977]).
* Restricted MSVC buffer debugging workaround to 2008, as it causes a crash with
  2010 beta 2 ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3796 #3796],
  [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3822 #3822]).
* Fixed a problem with the lifetime of handler memory, where Windows needs the
  `OVERLAPPED` structure to be valid until both the initiating function call
  has returned and the completion packet has been delivered.
* Don't block signals while performing system calls, but instead restart the
  calls if they are interrupted.
* Documented the guarantee made by strand objects with respect to order of
  handler invocation.
* Changed strands to use a pool of implementations, to make copying of strands
  cheaper.
* Ensured that kqueue support is enabled for BSD platforms
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3626 #3626]).
* Added a `boost_` prefix to the `extern "C"` thread entry point function
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3809 #3809]).
* In `getaddrinfo` emulation, only check the socket type (`SOCK_STREAM` or
  `SOCK_DGRAM`) if a service name has been specified. This should allow the
  emulation to work with raw sockets.
* Added a workaround for some broken Windows firewalls that make a socket
  appear bound to 0.0.0.0 when it is in fact bound to 127.0.0.1.
* Applied a fix for reported excessive CPU usage under Solaris
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3670 #3670]).
* Added some support for platforms that use older compilers such as g++ 2.95
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3743 #3743]).

[heading Asio 1.4.3 / Boost 1.40]

* Added a new ping example to illustrate the use of ICMP sockets.
* Changed the `buffered*_stream<>` templates to treat 0-byte reads and writes as
  no-ops, to comply with the documented type requirements for `SyncReadStream`,
  `AsyncReadStream`, `SyncWriteStream` and `AsyncWriteStream`.
* Changed some instances of the `throw` keyword to `boost::throw_exception()` to
  allow Asio to be used when exception support is disabled. Note that the SSL
  wrappers still require exception support
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2754 #2754]).
* Made Asio compatible with the OpenSSL 1.0 beta
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3256 #3256]).
* Eliminated a redundant system call in the Solaris [^/dev/poll] backend.
* Fixed a bug in resizing of the bucket array in the internal hash maps
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3095 #3095]).
* Ensured correct propagation of the error code when a synchronous accept fails
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3216 #3216]).
* Ensured correct propagation of the error code when a synchronous read or
  write on a Windows HANDLE fails.
* Fixed failures reported when `_GLIBCXX_DEBUG` is defined
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3098 #3098]).
* Fixed custom memory allocation support for timers
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3107 #3107]).
* Tidied up various warnings reported by g++
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/1341 #1341],
  [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2618 #2618]).
* Various documentation improvements, including more obvious hyperlinks to
  function overloads, header file information, examples for the handler type
  requirements, and adding enum values to the index
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3157 #3157],
  [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2620 #2620]).

[heading Asio 1.4.2 / Boost 1.39]

* Implement automatic resizing of the bucket array in the internal hash maps.
  This is to improve performance for very large numbers of asynchronous
  operations and also to reduce memory usage for very small numbers. A new
  macro `BOOST_ASIO_HASH_MAP_BUCKETS` may be used to tweak the sizes used for
  the bucket arrays. (N.B. this feature introduced a bug which was fixed in
  Asio 1.4.3 / Boost 1.40.)
* Add performance optimisation for the Windows IOCP backend for when no timers
  are used.
* Prevent locale settings from affecting formatting of TCP and UDP endpoints
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2682 #2682]).
* Fix a memory leak that occurred when an asynchronous SSL operation's
  completion handler threw an exception
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2910 #2910]).
* Fix the implementation of `io_control()` so that it adheres to the
  documented type requirements for IoControlCommand
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2820 #2820]).
* Fix incompatibility between Asio and ncurses.h
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2156 #2156]).
* On Windows, specifically handle the case when an overlapped `ReadFile` call
  fails with `ERROR_MORE_DATA`. This enables a hack where a
  `windows::stream_handle` can be used with a message-oriented named pipe
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2936 #2936]).
* Fix system call wrappers to always clear the error on success, as POSIX
  allows successful system calls to modify errno 
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2953 #2953]).
* Don't include termios.h if `BOOST_ASIO_DISABLE_SERIAL_PORT` is defined
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2917 #2917]).
* Cleaned up some more MSVC level 4 warnings
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2828 #2828]).
* Various documentation fixes
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2871 #2871]).

[heading Asio 1.4.1 / Boost 1.38]

* Improved compatibility with some Windows firewall software.
* Ensured arguments to `windows::overlapped_ptr::complete()` are correctly
  passed to the completion handler
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2614 #2614]).
* Fixed a link problem and multicast failure on QNX
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2504 #2504],
  [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2530 #2530]).
* Fixed a compile error in SSL support on MinGW / g++ 3.4.5.
* Drop back to using a pipe for notification if eventfd is not available at
  runtime on Linux ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2683 #2683]).
* Various minor bug and documentation fixes
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2534 #2534],
  [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2541 #2541],
  [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2607 #2607],
  [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2617 #2617],
  [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2619 #2619]).

[heading Asio 1.4.0 / Boost 1.37]

* Enhanced CompletionCondition concept with the signature
  `size_t CompletionCondition(error_code ec, size_t total)`, where the return
  value indicates the maximum number of bytes to be transferred on the next
  read or write operation. (The old CompletionCondition signature is still
  supported for backwards compatibility).
* New windows::overlapped_ptr class to allow arbitrary overlapped I/O
  functions (such as TransmitFile) to be used with Asio.
* On recent versions of Linux, an eventfd descriptor is now used (rather than
  a pipe) to interrupt a blocked select/epoll reactor.
* Added const overloads of lowest_layer().
* Synchronous read, write, accept and connect operations are now thread safe
  (meaning that it is now permitted to perform concurrent synchronous
  operations on an individual socket, if supported by the OS).
* Reactor-based io_service implementations now use lazy initialisation to
  reduce the memory usage of an io_service object used only as a message
  queue.

[heading Asio 1.2.0 / Boost 1.36]

* Added support for serial ports.
* Added support for UNIX domain sockets.
* Added support for raw sockets and ICMP.
* Added wrappers for POSIX stream-oriented file descriptors (excluding regular
  files).
* Added wrappers for Windows stream-oriented `HANDLE`s such as named pipes
  (requires `HANDLE`s that work with I/O completion ports).
* Added wrappers for Windows random-access `HANDLE`s such as files (requires
  `HANDLE`s that work with I/O completion ports).
* Added support for reactor-style operations (i.e. they report readiness but
  perform no I/O) using a new `null_buffers` type.
* Added an iterator type for bytewise traversal of buffer sequences.
* Added new `read_until()` and `async_read_until()` overloads that take a
  user-defined function object for locating message boundaries.
* Added an experimental two-lock queue (enabled by defining
  `BOOST_ASIO_ENABLE_TWO_LOCK_QUEUE`) that may provide better `io_service`
  scalability across many processors.
* Various fixes, performance improvements, and more complete coverage of the
  custom memory allocation support.

[heading Asio 1.0.0 / Boost 1.35]
