    <h4>Variadic Macros</h4>
    <div> Variadic macros are supported by nearly all compilers.
      Variadic macros are macros of the form: </div>
    <div class="code">
      <pre>#define SOME_MACRO(ZeroOrMoreParameters,...) macro expansion possible specifying __VA_ARGS__</pre>
    </div>
    <div> The '...' in the parameter list represents the variadic data
      when the macro is invoked and the __VA_ARGS__ in the expansion
      represents the variadic data in the expansion of the macro.
      Variadic data is of the form of 1 or more preprocessor tokens
      separated by commas.<br>
      <br>
      The '...' must be the last parameter in the macro definition and
      there may be 0 or more non-variadic parameters preceding it.<br>
      <br>
      In the expansion of the macro __VA_ARGS__ may be specified 0 or
      more times to represent the variadic data. The variadic data in
      the expansion is a comma separated list of preprocessor tokens
      representing the variadic data which the invoker of the macro
      enters as the last arguments to the macro.<br>
    </div>
    <h4>Example<u> - Creating and invoking a variadic macro.</u></h4>
    <div class="code">
      <pre>#define INITIALIZE_INT_ARRAY(array_name,...) \ <br> static int array_name[] = { __VA_ARGS__ }; \ <br> /**/<br><br> INITIALIZE_INT_ARRAY(myname,45,789,33510,9346,2)</pre>
    </div>
    <u> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Preprocessor Library Support<br>
      </span></u>
    <div>The library requires support for variadic macros for all
      compilers using the library. This usually means that compilation
      at the C level is C99 or higher and that compilation at the C++
      level is C++11 or higher. Many C++ compilers support variadic
      macros at the C++98/C++03 level as long as strict compliance is
      not turned on for those compilers at that level. In particular
      both the gcc and clang compilers will support variadic macros at
      the C++98/C++03 levels as long as strict ANSI compliance is not
      turned on at that level. For those compilers this largely means
      that the <code>-pedantic</code> or <code>-pedantic-errors</code>
      option is not used at the C++98/C++03 level of compilation. Boost
      C++ is deprecating compiling Boost libraries at the C++98/C++03
      level, so if you must still use this library at that level be
      aware of these aforementioned caveats.<br>
      <br>
      <a name="vmvcquirk"></a>Visual C++'s default preprocessor has a
      few quirks related to variadic macros which require the end-user
      to code slightly differently. When Visual C++'s default
      preprocessor is being used BOOST_PP_VARIADICS_MSVC is 1, otherwise
      it is 0. In this way the end-user can test for the presence of
      Visual C++'s default preprocessor and code accordingly.<br>
      <br>
      Support for working with variadic data is largely centered on
      being able to convert variadic data to other library data types,
      since the functionality for working with those Boost preprocessor
      library data types is much greater than that for working with
      variadic data directly.<br>
    </div>
    <a name="VNotation"></a>
    <h4>Extended Functionality Using Variadic Macros<br>
    </h4>
    <div>Some macros in the library offer extended functionality through
      the use of variadic macros.<br>
      <br>
      The variadic macro version offers extended functionality because
      of the ability of the variadic parameters to encompass a variable
      number of arguments. The library has functionality which can know
      the number of variadic arguments passed when invoking a variadic
      macro. This allows the same variadic macro to work with different
      numbers of parameters, therefore providing more than one
      syntactical equivalent for the same macro name.<br>
      <br>
      The macros in the library which offer this enhanced functionality
      are all centered on <i>tuple</i> manipulation. With variadic
      macros it is possible to manipulate tuples without having to know
      the size of the tuple. So while the invoker can still specify the
      size when using tuple macro functionality, there are syntactical
      versions of each of the tuple macros where the size need not be
      specified.<br>
    </div>
    <h4>Extended Support For Variadic Data</h4>
    <div>The library offers extended support for working with variadic
      data which goes beyond the functionality offered by the C++
      specification for variadic macros. It does this through
      preprocessor programming and by using some of the other
      functionality in the library itself.<br>
      <br>
      The form of the functionality which the library offers is centered
      on two macros which work with variadic data itself, and a set of
      macros which convert between variadic data and other library data
      types.<br>
      <br>
      The two macros are BOOST_PP_VARIADIC_ELEM and
      BOOST_PP_VARIADIC_SIZE, which respectively return a particular
      token of variadic data and the number of tokens of variadic data.<br>
      <br>
      The macros for converting variadic data to the library's data
      types are BOOST_PP_VARIADIC_TO_ARRAY, BOOST_PP_VARIADIC_TO_LIST,
      BOOST_PP_VARIADIC_TO_SEQ, and BOOST_PP_VARIADIC_TO_TUPLE.<br>
      <br>
      The remaining four macros, which convert from a library data type
      to comma-separated preprocessor tokens, which is the form of
      variadic data, do not use variadic macros. These functions are
      BOOST_PP_ARRAY_ENUM, BOOST_PP_LIST_ENUM, BOOST_PP_SEQ_ENUM, and
      BOOST_PP_TUPLE_ENUM. You can use this variadic data reliably as
      arguments to other macros using variadic macro support.<br>
    </div>
    <h4><a name="C20_Support_For_Variadic_Macros"></a>C++20 Support For
      Variadic Macros</h4>
    <div> In the C++20 specification there is a new construct which can
      be used in the expansion of a variadic macro, called __VA_OPT__.
      This construct when used in the expansion of a variadic macro is
      followed by an opening paranthesis '(', preprocessor data, and a
      closing parenthesis ')'. When the variadic data passed by the
      invocation of a variadic macro is empty, this new construct
      expands to nothing. When the variadic data passed by the
      invocation of a variadic macro is not empty, this new construct
      expands to the preprocessor data between its opening and closing
      parentheses. <br>
      <br>
      This library offers support for this new C++20 construct by
      automatically detecting whether this new construct is supported by
      the compiler's preprocessor when using the library. The library
      macro which detects support for the __VA_OPT__ construct is called
      BOOST_PP_VARIADIC_HAS_OPT. This is a function-like macro which
      takes no parameters and returns 1 if the compiler is working in
      C++20 mode and supports the __VA_OPT__ construct, while otherwise
      it returns 0. <br>
      <br>
      When the __VA_OPT__ construct is supported in C++20 mode the
      variadic data passed to the variadic macros and to
      BOOST_PP_OVERLOAD can be empty, otherwise when not in this mode
      variadic data passed to the variadic macros should never be empty.
      In this C+++20 mode invoking BOOST_PP_VARIADIC_SIZE with empty
      data expands to 0, invoking BOOST_PP_VARIADIC_TO_ARRAY with empty
      data expands to the empty array '(0,())', invoking
      BOOST_PP_VARIADIC_TO_LIST with empty data expands to the empty
      list 'BOOST_PP_NIL', and invoking BOOST_PP_OVERLOAD with empty
      data creates an overload name with 0 appended. Similarly in this
      C++20 mode passing an empty array '(0,())' to BOOST_PP_ARRAY_ENUM
      expands to empty variadic data and passing an empty list
      'BOOST_PP_NIL' to BOOST_PP_LIST_ENUM also expands to empty
      variadic data. Neither a seq or a tuple can be empty so passing
      empty variadic data to either BOOST_PP_VARIADIC_TO_SEQ or
      BOOST_PP_VARIADIC_TO_TUPLE is erroneous. Likewise passing empty
      data to BOOST_PP_VARIADIC_ELEM is always erroneous since there are
      no tokens of variadic data to access.<br>
    </div>
    <u style="font-weight: bold;"> Using a Tuple Instead of an Array<br>
    </u>
    <div>An array as a preprocessor data type is a two-element tuple
      where the first element is the array size and the second element
      is a tuple which constitutes the array data. Because a tuple knows
      its own size because of compiler support for variadic macros,
      there is no reason to use the array preprocessor data type as
      opposed to the tuple preprocessor data type; the tuple data type
      now has all of the functionality which the array data type has and
      is syntactically easier to use. The preprocessor array data type
      is essentially obsolete for modern C++ compilers.</div>
    <u style="font-weight: bold;">Using Variadic Data</u>
    <div>Variadic data exists in the form of comma-separated
      preprocessor tokens. This is the case whether the variadic data
      comes from the __VA_ARGS__ of a variadic macro, from the
      conversion of a library's data type to variadic data, or the
      manual construction of comma-separated preprocessing tokens by the
      programmer writing a macro.<br>
      <br>
      The easiest way to work with variadic data internally is to
      convert it to a library data type. Library data types, whether an
      <i>array</i>, <i>list</i>, <i>sequence</i>, or <i>tuple</i>,
      have a rich set of functionality for manipulating data whereas
      variadic data functionality in the library only allows one to
      access the variadic data as a whole or to access a single token of
      the variadic data at a time.<br>
      <br>
      The user of the library still may choose to pass variadic data
      back into internal macros rather than convert it to other library
      data types. There is no problem passing variadic data as a whole
      to variadic macros as the last parameter of the macro. However: <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Attempting to pass variadic data
        as a whole directly into a non-variadic macro is not guaranteed
        to work and may fail.<br>
      </span><br>
      This occurs because of a preprocessor weakness in a number of
      compilers, currently most notably Visual C++'s default
      preprocessor. Even passing variadic data as arguments to a
      non-variadic macro, when it is not represented in the form
      of&nbsp; __VA_ARGS__, may fail with certain compilers.<br>
      <br>
      What follows are very simple examples, showing how variadic data
      can be passed to a non-variadic macro.<br>
      <br>
      First an example of what NOT to do.<br>
    </div>
    <h4>Example<u> - Passing variadic data as a whole to a non-variadic
        macro. DO NOT DO.</u></h4>
    <div class="code">
      <pre>#define MACRO_ARG_2(x,y) BOOST_PP_ADD(x,y)<br>#define VAR_MACRO(...) __VA_ARGS__<br><br>/* The following should not be done and is not guaranteed to work with compilers. */<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: monospace;"></span></span>int xx = MACRO_ARG_2(VAR_MACRO(2,3));</pre>
    </div>
    <div> There are two ways to pass variadic data to a non-variadic
      macro. The first of these is to pass the individual tokens of the
      variadic data separately to the non-variadic macro using the
      BOOST_PP_VARIADIC_ELEM macro in the library.<br>
    </div>
    <h4>Example<u> - Passing individual variadic data tokens to a
        non-variadic macro.<br>
      </u></h4>
    <div class="code">
      <pre>#define MACRO_ARG_2(x,y) BOOST_PP_ADD(x,y)<br>#define VAR_MACRO(...) __VA_ARGS__<br><br>/* The following will work correctly */<br><br>int xx = MACRO_ARG_2<br> (<br> BOOST_PP_VARIADIC_ELEM(0,VAR_MACRO(2,3)),<br> BOOST_PP_VARIADIC_ELEM(1,VAR_MACRO(2,3))<br> );</pre>
    </div>
    <div>The second way is to use a macro in the library called
      BOOST_PP_OVERLOAD. This macro allows one to "overload" a variadic
      macro to non-variadic macros of different numbers of parameters,
      using a common prefix. </div>
    <h4>Example<u> - Passing variadic data as a whole to
        BOOST_PP_OVERLOAD and on to a non-variadic macro.<br>
      </u></h4>
    <div class="code">
      <pre>#define MACRO_ARG_2(x,y) BOOST_PP_ADD(x,y)<br>#define VAR_MACRO(...) __VA_ARGS__<br><br>/* The following will work correctly */<br><br>int xx = BOOST_PP_OVERLOAD(MACRO_ARG_,VAR_MACRO(2,3))(VAR_MACRO(2,3));<br><br>/* For Visual C++'s default preprocessor it is necessary to do this */<br><br>int xx = <br>BOOST_PP_CAT(BOOST_PP_OVERLOAD(MACRO_ARG_,VAR_MACRO(2,3))(VAR_MACRO(2,3)),BOOST_PP_EMPTY());</pre>
    </div>
    <div>Although these techniques will work when passing variadic data
      to non-variadic macros, it is much better and less problematical
      to work internally with the existing library data types and to
      only use variadic macros as an interface for end-users when there
      is a need to have a macro which takes a variable number of
      parameters.<br>
