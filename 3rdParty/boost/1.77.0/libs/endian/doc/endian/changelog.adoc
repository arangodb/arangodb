# Revision History

## Changes in 1.75.0

* `endian_arithmetic` no longer inherits from `endian_buffer`
* When `BOOST_ENDIAN_NO_CTORS` is defined, the unaligned `endian_buffer` and
  `endian_arithmetic` are {cpp}03 PODs, to enable use of `++__attribute__((packed))++`

## Changes in 1.74.0

* Enabled scoped enumeration types in `endian_reverse`
* Enabled `bool`, `enum`, `float`, `double` in `endian_reverse_inplace`
* Added an overload of `endian_reverse_inplace` for arrays

## Changes in 1.72.0

* Made `endian_reverse`, `conditional_reverse` and `\*\_to_*` `constexpr`
  on GCC and Clang
* Added convenience load and store functions
* Added floating point convenience typedefs
* Added a non-const overload of `data()`; changed its return type to `unsigned char*`
* Added `__int128` support to `endian_reverse` when available
* Added a convenience header `boost/endian.hpp`

## Changes in 1.71.0

* Clarified requirements on the value type template parameter
* Added support for `float` and `double` to `endian_buffer` and `endian_arithmetic`
* Added `endian_load`, `endian_store`
* Updated `endian_reverse` to correctly support all non-`bool` integral types
* Moved deprecated names to the deprecated header `endian.hpp`
