WKT is a general markup format in ASCII.
It is described in detail on [@http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text Wikipedia]

Boost Geometry supports the common formats (POINT, LINESTRING, POLYGON, MULTIPOINT, MULTILINESTRING, MULTIPOLYGON).

Because Boost.Geometry also supports Box and Segment geometries, which are not standard OGC geometries, there are some extensions:

[heading Box]
* can be read from WKT by specifying either a polygon (with 4 points) or a specific BOX string (non OGC)
* streamed to WKT as a POLYGON

[heading Segment]
* can be read from WKT by specifying either a linestring (with 2 points) or a specific SEGMENT string (non OGC)
* streamed to WKT as a LINESTRING

[heading Ring]
* can be read from WKT by specifying a polygon (with no holes)
* streamed to WKT as POLYGON
