[def __this_function__ discrete_hausdorff_distance]

[heading Behavior]
The algorithm calculate discrete hausdorff distance between two geometries.

[note The units of the distance depends on strategy. In order to change the
default behavior a user has to create a strategy and pass it explicitly into
the algorithm.]
