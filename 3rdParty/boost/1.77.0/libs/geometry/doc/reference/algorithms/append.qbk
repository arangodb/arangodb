[[Case] [Behavior] ]
[[__point__, __box__, __segment__][Compiles, but no action]]
[[__linestring__][Appends point or range to the end of the linestring]]
[[__ring__][Appends point or range to the end of the ring (without explicitly closing it)]]
[[__polygon__][Appends point or range to the end of the polygon (without explicitly closing it), 
	either the exterior ring (the default) or specify a zero-based index for one of the interior rings. 
	In the last case, the interior rings are not resized automatically, 
	so ensure that the zero-based index is smaller than the number of interior rings]]
[[__multi_linestring__][Appends point or range to the end of the
        linestring with the given multi index.
        The multi-linestring is not resized automatically, so ensure
        that the multi index is smaller than then number of linestring
        in the multi-linestring.]]
[[__multi_polygon__][Appends point or range to the end of the polygon
        (without explicitly closing it) with the given multi-index.
        The point or range is appended at the end of the
        exterior ring (the default) or specify a zero-based ring index for
        the interior rings.
        The multi-polygon is not resized automatically, so ensure
        that the multi index is smaller than then number of polygon
        in the multi-polygon. The same applies for the interior rings
        of the polygon: the interior rings are not resized
        automatically, so ensure that the zero-based ring index is
        smaller than the number of interior rings of the polygon.]]
