[note PostGIS contains an algorithm ST_Segmentize with the same functionality.
  See the [@http://www.postgis.org/docs/ST_Segmentize.html PostGIS documentation].

[heading Behavior]
The algorithm divides segments of a geometry if they are longer than passed
distance into smaller segments.

[note The units of the distance depends on strategy. In order to change the
default behavior a user has to create a strategy and pass it explicitly into
the algorithm.]
