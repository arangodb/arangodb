[section:equals_3_with_strategy equals (with strategy)]

'''<indexterm><primary>equals</primary></indexterm>'''
Checks if a geometry are spatially equal. 

[heading Description]
The free function equals checks if the first geometry is spatially equal the second geometry. Spatially equal means that the same point set is included. A box can therefore be spatially equal to a ring or a polygon, or a linestring can be spatially equal to a multi-linestring or a segment. This only works theoretically, not all combinations are implemented yet.

[heading Synopsis]
``template<typename Geometry1, typename Geometry2, typename Strategy>
bool equals(Geometry1 const & geometry1, Geometry2 const & geometry2, Strategy const & strategy)``

[heading Parameters]

[table
[[Type] [Concept] [Name] [Description] ]
[[Geometry1 const &] [Any type fulfilling a Geometry Concept ] [geometry1] [A model of the specified concept ]]
[[Geometry2 const &] [Any type fulfilling a Geometry Concept ] [geometry2] [A model of the specified concept ]]
[[Strategy const &] [Any type fulfilling a Equals Strategy Concept ] [strategy] [The strategy which will be used for equals calculations ]]
]


[heading Returns]
Returns true if two geometries are spatially equal

[heading Header]
Either

`#include <boost/geometry.hpp>`


Or

`#include <boost/geometry/algorithms/equals.hpp>`
