'''<indexterm><primary>convert</primary></indexterm>'''
Converts one geometry to another geometry. 

[heading Description]
The convert algorithm converts one geometry, e.g. a BOX, to another geometry, e.g. a RING. This only works if it is possible and applicable. If the point-order is different, or the closure is different between two geometry types, it will be converted correctly by explicitly reversing the points or closing or opening the polygon rings.

[heading Synopsis]
``template<typename Geometry1, typename Geometry2>
void convert(Geometry1 const & geometry1, Geometry2 & geometry2)``

[heading Parameters]

[table
[[Type] [Concept] [Name] [Description] ]
[[Geometry1 const &] [Any type fulfilling a Geometry Concept ] [geometry1] [A model of the specified concept (source) ]]
[[Geometry2 &] [Any type fulfilling a Geometry Concept ] [geometry2] [A model of the specified concept (target)]]
]
