[section:eigen Eigen Interoperability]

This library provides the header:

   #include <boost/multiprecision/eigen.hpp>

which defines the traits classes and functions that the Eigen library needs all user-defined number types to provide.

For example the following code performs quad-precision matrix solving on complex numbers:

[eigen_eg]

Which produces the following output:

[eigen_out]
