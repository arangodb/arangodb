[section string]

Modifiable sequences of characters are represented using objects of type __string__.
The interface and functionality of __string__ is
the same as `std::basic_string` except that:

* __string__ is not a class template,

* __string__ uses `char` as its character type,

* redundant overloads for string operations have been replaced
with a __string_view__ based interface,

* access to characters in the range `[size(), capacity())` is permitted, and

* __storage_ptr__ is used instead of __Allocator__.

With augmented interface, operations requiring an input string
are implemented as a single overload with a parameter of type
__string_view__, and can accept most string-like objects.
Objects such as null terminated character pointers, `std::string`,
`json::string`, subranges of strings, and objects
convertible to __string_view__ can all be passed to these functions.

[snippet_strings_4]

More formally, `std::string` member function overloads that accept any of the
following parameter combinations as an input string:

* a `std::string` parameter, or

* a `std::string` parameter and two `size_type` parameters that specify a substring, or

* a parameter of a type convertible to __string_view__, or

* a parameter of a type convertible to __string_view__ and two
`size_type` parameters that specify a substring, or

* a `const_pointer`, or

* a parameter of type `const_pointer` and a `size_type` parameter
that specifies the length of the string

are replaced with an overload accepting a __string_view__ parameter.

This design removes several redundant overloads from the interface.
For example, the 11 overloads of `std::string::insert` are reduced
to just 3 in __string__, while still providing identical functionality.
In addition to these changes, overloads taking a `std::initializer_list<char>`
parameter have been removed. Such overloads have little use,
as they serve as little more than a wrappers for arrays with an inefficient syntax:

[snippet_strings_3]

With the removal of overloads that specify parameters for a substring, a member function
`subview` that returns a __string_view__ is provided to facilitate cheap substring operations:

[snippet_strings_2]

A __string__ may be constructed using the default memory resource without incurring any
memory allocations. Alternatively, a __storage_ptr__ can be provided explicitly:

[snippet_strings_1]

[heading Formatted Output]

When a __string__ is formatted to a __std_ostream__, the result is a valid
JSON. That is, the result will be double quoted and the contents properly
escaped per the JSON specification.
