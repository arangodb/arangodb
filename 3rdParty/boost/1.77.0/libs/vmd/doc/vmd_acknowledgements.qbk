[section:vmd_ack Acknowledgements]

First and foremost I would like to thank Paul Mensonides for providing 
advice, explanation and code for working with variadic macros and macros 
in general. Secondly I would like to thank Steve Watanabe for his help, code, 
and explanations. Finally I have to acknowledge that this library is an amalgam 
of already known techniques for dealing with variadic macros themselves, 
among which are techniques published online by Paul Mensonides. I have added 
design and some cleverness in creating the library but I could not have done 
it without the previous knowledge of others.
