[#ref_CHANGE_LOG_3_14][h4 Boost.Test v3.14 / boost 1.74]

[h5 New features]

* Now able to detect when running under a debugger on macOS/iOS. When running under a debugger, Boost.Test does not
  try to catch system errors and the behaviour is the same as if the command line [link boost_test.utf_reference.rt_param_reference.catch_system `catch_system_error`]
  option was set to `no`. Thanks to [@https://github.com/thughes Tom Hughes] for this feature.
* Adding support for Embarcadero C++ clang-based compilers, thanks to [@https://github.com/eldiener Edward Diener]

[h5 Bugfixes and feature requests]

[#ref_CHANGE_LOG_3_13][h4 Boost.Test v3.13 / boost 1.73]

[h5 New features]

* It is now possible to combine tolerance indication, user message and collection comparison modifier in a single `BOOST_TEST` expression

  ``
  std::vector<double> v1 = f();
  std::vector<double> v2{1.1, 1.19};
  BOOST_TEST(v1 == v2, boost::test_tools::tolerance( 1e-3 ) << "comparison to ground truth failed" << boost::test_tools::per_element());
  ``

[#ref_CHANGE_LOG_3_11][h4 Boost.Test v3.11 / boost 1.71]

[h5 New features]
* Now `BOOST_TEST` can be used to compare abstract types

[h5 Breaking changes]

* Marking more headers as deprecated: this might break some compilations
  depending on the warning policies.

[h5 Bugfixes and feature requests]

# Fixing a small bug on named timers (Windows only). The bug is visible when
  several test modules are executed in parallel on the same machine.

# [github_issue 209] `BOOST_TEST_CHECK` can't compare abstract classes using gcc
# [github_issue 218] Default file name (for logger output files)

# [pull_request 219] Commented out unused argument name (`stack_decorator::apply`)
# [pull_request 224] Add `BOOST_HEADER_DEPRECATED` to deprecated headers

[#ref_CHANGE_LOG_3_10][h4 Boost.Test v3.10 / boost 1.70]

[h5 New features]
* New documentation section about [link boost_test.runtime_config.custom_command_line_arguments custom command line]
  arguments
* [link boost_test.tests_organization.test_cases.test_case_generation.datasets.dataset_interface Custom datasets]
  are not required to declare a inner type `sample` anymore
* Boost.Test does not depend on Boost.Timer any more (which was pulling also Boost.Chrono
  and Boost.System as transitive dependencies).
* Now Boost.Test raises an exception when the test case times-out on Windows. Prior to this release,
  times-out on Windows were not failing the test cases. Note that signaling is not available on Windows,
  and it is not possible to interrupt a test even in case of time out.
* Time-out now applies to test-suites as well: a test-suite is marked as timed-out if it exceeds the allocated
  time. The test units that were not executed at the time-point of the time-out are skipped.
* It is now possible to pass several values for the same context via the tool
  __BOOST_TEST_CONTEXT__.
* A new macro __BOOST_TEST_INFO_SCOPE__ let define a context for the current scope in a sticky way.
* It is now possible to use [link boost_test.testing_tools.extended_comparison.floating_point floating point]
  comparison without being required to cast both operands to floating point types. Now Boost.Test uses floating
  point comparisons for expressions such as

  ``
  BOOST_TEST(3.0001 == 3);
  ``

  See [link boost_test.testing_tools.extended_comparison.floating_point.type_promotion_of_the_operands this section]
  for more information.

[h5 Breaking changes]
* Boost.Test `minimal.hpp` is now showing a deprecation warning. `minimal.hpp` has been
  deprecated for a long time already, and will be removed in the near future. Please
  switch to eg. the header only variable of Boost.Test. Tests using `minimal.hpp` can
  readily be converted to the header variant. For instance, the following code:

  ``
  #include <boost/test/minimal.hpp>
  int test_main( int, char *[] )
  {
    ...
  }
  ``

  may be rewritten as:

  ``
  #include <boost/test/included/unit_test.hpp>
  BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE(test_main)
  {
    ...
  }
  ``
* The floating point comparison behavior change may use this type of comparison while previously
  using straight relational operator comparison. In particular this may causes ['new warnings].

* the member function [memberref boost::unit_test::unit_test_log_formatter::log_build_info] has slightly changed
  to accept an additional boolean argument. If you have a custom logger, you will need to update its signature.

[h5 New features]
* Official support of header-only variant of Boost.Test with multiple translation units. This feature
  was available but needed to be properly documented ([link boost_test.adv_scenarios.single_header_customizations.multiple_translation_units here]
  and [link boost_test.usage_variants here]).
* It is now possible to manually add a test case by specifying its name, with __BOOST_TEST_CASE_NAME__
* Better logging of messages in `boost::exception`

[#ref_CHANGE_LOG_3_8][h4 Boost.Test v3.8 / boost 1.68]

[h5 New features]
* The tests generated from a dataset are now instantiated during the framework setup. This
  let the dataset generator access the `argc` and `argv` of the master test suite. For indicating
  a dataset that should be instantiated in a delayed manner, a new `data::make_delayed` helper has
  been introduced.
* It is now possible to create a dataset with `data::make`, with variable number of arguments.
  As the datasets are monomorphic, it should be possible to cast all elements to the first element type.

[h5 Breaking changes]
* the [link boost_test.tests_organization.test_tree.master_test_suite `master_test_suite_t`] is not copyable anymore.
* As datasets can now be delayed, it might be that additional copies of the dataset arguments are performed.
  This is especially the case for datasets created out of an `std::initializer_list`.

[h5 Bugfixes and feature requests]
# [pull_request 143] Fix exception_api.run-fail.cpp doc example
# [pull_request 145] Fix build of library on recent Cygwin editions
# [ticket 12095] disabling test with precondition leads to error
# [ticket 12953] access to `master_test_suite().{argc, argv}`
# [ticket 13504] `[Boost::Test]` short form of `catch_system_errors` not working
# [ticket 13525] Boost Test 1.67.0: Compilation error with GCC 4.6.3
# [ticket 13528] Boost Test 1.67 crashes when the `--report_sink` command-line parameter is used


[#ref_CHANGE_LOG_3_7][h4 Boost.Test v3.7 / boost 1.67]

[h5 Breaking changes]

* Now colour is on by default for the output streams that are either `std::cout` or `std::cerr`. This can be
  disabled by passing [link boost_test.utf_reference.rt_param_reference.color_output `--no_color_ouput`] (or just `--no_color`)
  to the command line.
* Adding test cases with the same name to the same test suite is reported as an error. This impacts
  [link boost_test.tests_organization.test_cases.test_organization_templates template] and
  [link boost_test.tests_organization.test_cases.param_test parametrized] test cases, as well as manually
  registered tests. Make sure you have no duplicate names.

[h5 New features]
* Colour output on Windows
* Improved and clearer command line help
* `BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE_TEMPLATE` now accepts a sequence of types in an `std::tuple`

[h5 Bugfixes and feature requests]
# [pull_request 112] Deliberate-failure tests shouldn't be optimized

# [ticket 13443] Boost.Test data driven test fails to compile when number of samples greater than 9

[#ref_CHANGE_LOG_3_6][h4 Boost.Test v3.6 / boost 1.65]

[h5 Breaking changes]
* __BOOST_GLOBAL_FIXTURE__ is flagged as deprecated and will be removed in a later version
* Using test assertions and macros is not allowed when used inside __BOOST_GLOBAL_FIXTURE__. Please use __BOOST_TEST_GLOBAL_FIXTURE__
  instead (see below).
* the interface for loggers has slightly changed to take into account the current log level. This is for addressing [ticket 12631].

[h5 New features]
* VS2017 / C++17 compatibility (thanks to Daniela Engert)
* Deprecating __BOOST_GLOBAL_FIXTURE__ in favor of __BOOST_TEST_GLOBAL_FIXTURE__ and __BOOST_TEST_GLOBAL_CONFIGURATION__. This
  helps separating the logic of the fixtures associated to the master test suite, from the one used for setting up the logging
  and reporting facility, and results in a general cleaner design.
* It is possible to use now the __BOOST_TEST__ check to comparing a collection with respect to regular arrays. See
  [link ref_boost_test_coll_c_arrays this section] for more details.

[h5 Bugfixes and feature requests]
# [pull_request 106] replace deprecated binders and adapters, and `random_shuffle` by more modern equivalents
# [ticket 5282] Test fixtures do not support virtual inheritance
# [ticket 5563] using a test macro in a global fixture crashes Boost.Test
# [ticket 11471] array is a sequence
# [ticket 11962] `BOOST_TEST_MESSAGE` in fixture constructor - invalid XML
# [ticket 12228] Some test headers fail to compile independently
# [ticket 12631] `BOOST_TEST_MESSAGE` generates incorrect output when used in `BOOST_DATA_TEST_CASE`
# [ticket 13011] `BOOST_TEST` broken with floating point relational operators

[#ref_CHANGE_LOG_3_5][h4 Boost.Test v3.5 / boost 1.64]

[h5 New features]
* Now Boost.Test provides [link ref_log_output_custom_customization_point customization points] for logging user defined types:
  this solution is less intrusive than forcing the definition of `operator<<` for a specific type.
* [link boost_test.test_output.log_formats.log_junit_format JUnit output format] can now have a
  [link boost_test.test_output.log_formats.test_log_output log-level] set between `success` and
  `non-fatal error`, and defaults to `general information`.
* [link boost_test.test_output.log_formats.log_junit_format JUnit output format] is now more
  efficient in case a lot of checks are done in a test module.

[h5 Bugfixes and feature requests]
# [pull_request 107] `BOOST_NO_EXCEPTIONS` typo making `throw_exception` unusable under some circumstances
# [pull_request 108] Change capital variable names to lowercase
# [ticket 11756] boost.Test: non standards compliant use of `FE_*` macros (unable to compile boost test library on FPU-less arches) (reopened)
# [ticket 12540] Provide customization point for printing types in tests
# [ticket 12712] `BOOST_AUTO_TEST_SUITE`: Generate unique names by using `__COUNTER__`
# [ticket 12748] Boost.Test defines a variable called `VERSION`
# [ticket 12778] Boost.Test is broken against left shift operator in certain cases (`nullptr` issue)

[#ref_CHANGE_LOG_3_4][h4 Boost.Test v3.4 / boost 1.63]

[h5 Breaking changes]
# Now colons that appear in test case names are replaced with underscores. This affect mainly the
  [link boost_test.tests_organization.test_cases.test_organization_templates template/typed test cases].
  The change is needed since the colon '`:`' is interpreted as a filter separators since 1.62, and it is
  otherwise not possible to execute the tests reported by `--list_content`. See [ticket 12531] for more details.

[h5 New features]
* Now [link boost_test_coll_perelement `per_element`] and [link boost_test_coll_default_lex `lexicographic`] modifiers of __BOOST_TEST__
  can also be applied to string comparison. See
  [link boost_test.testing_tools.extended_comparison.strings string comparison] for more details.

[h5 Bugfixes and feature requests]

# [ticket 12531] `--run_test` in Boost 1.62 does not accept test names which contain ':'

[#ref_CHANGE_LOG_3_3][h4 Boost.Test v3.3 / boost 1.62]

[h5 New features]
* Boost.Test now treats each sample of a dataset test case as being a uniquely named test case under the same test suite,
  which enables the (re)run of one particular sample from the command line interface. See
  [link boost_test.tests_organization.test_cases.test_case_generation.datasets_auto_registration.samples_and_test_tree here]
  for more details,
* Boost.Test learned to interpret ':' as a separator for the test filters: the string passed to
  [link boost_test.utf_reference.rt_param_reference.run_test `--run_test`]
  generates tokens as if `--run_test` has been repeated, which enables the set up of several test filters
  through the associated environment variable `BOOST_TEST_RUN_FILTERS`
* the __UTF__ learned to log the messages in the xUnit/JUNIT log format.
  See [link boost_test.test_output.log_formats.log_junit_format here] for more details.
* the __UTF__ learned to have several loggers at the same time, each of which with their own log level and log sink.
  See the associated command line switch [link boost_test.utf_reference.rt_param_reference.logger `--logger`] and
  corresponding environment variable `BOOST_TEST_LOGGER` for more details.
* loggers are now able to indicate their default output stream and log level.

[#ref_CHANGE_LOG_3_2][h4 Boost.Test v3.2 / boost 1.61]

[h5 New features]
* now datasets support any [link boost_test.tests_organization.test_cases.test_case_generation.datasets arity], using the
  variadic template support of the compiler.
* now datasets support fixtures through `BOOST_DATA_TEST_CASE_F`, see
  [link boost_test.tests_organization.test_cases.test_case_generation.datasets here] for more details
* now datasets honors move semantics of the types used for samples

[#ref_CHANGE_LOG_3_1][h4 Boost.Test v3.1 / boost 1.60]

[h5 New major features]
* improved API for datasets
  * it is now possible to use initializer lists
  * the use of `make` as top left dataset is not necessary anymore
* improved command line interface
  * clearer help commands
  * now proposes closest matching command in case of ambiguity
  * reports invalid or ambiguous parameters: this might break existing calls when user defined commands are
    provided to the test module. The following calling convention should be adopted:
    * if the test module uses user supplied commands, those should be passed after an empty token `--`
    * all boost.test related commands should be passed before `--`, if any

    Example:
    the call
    ``
    test_module --user-arg1=xy --log_level=test_suite
    ``
    should be rewritten to
    ``
    test_module --log_level=test_suite -- --user-arg1=xy
    ``

[#ref_CHANGE_LOG_3_0][h4 Boost.Test v3 / boost 1.59]

[h5 New major features]

* __BOOST_TEST__ generic assertion
* [link boost_test.tests_organization.test_cases.test_case_generation data driven test cases]: supersedes the parametric test case (unary test cases)
* test units [link boost_test.tests_organization.decorators attributes], that allow finer control over test units property and behavior
* logical grouping of the test units using [link boost_test.tests_organization.tests_grouping labels]
* support for declaring [link boost_test.tests_organization.tests_dependencies dependencies] over test cases
* attributes for [link boost_test.tests_organization.enabling enabling or disabling] test execution based on static, compile-time or runtime rules
* extended [link boost_test.runtime_config.test_unit_filtering unit test filtering] from the command line (negation, labels, ...)
* color output with [link boost_test.utf_reference.rt_param_reference.color_output `color_output`]
* test bed listing with [link boost_test.utf_reference.rt_param_reference.list_content `list_content`]
* rewritten documentation using quickbook

[/* now having a more accurate timing (see [ticket 7397]) for the tests. Old format is still available through the command line option __param_deprecated_timer_format__
