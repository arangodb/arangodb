[section:bitwise Bitwise comparison]

[caution this feature is not available for non C++11 compilers.]

The manipulator [classref boost::test_tools::bitwise] can be provided to the __BOOST_TEST__ macro in order to have a bitwise comparison
of the operands. In that case, the __UTF__ indicates the bit indices where the two operands do not match.

[bt_example boost_test_bitwise..BOOST_TEST bitwise comparison..run-fail]

[note the indices start at least significant bit.]
