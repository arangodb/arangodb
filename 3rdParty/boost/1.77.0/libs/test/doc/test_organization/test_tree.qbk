[section:test_tree Test tree]

The test tree is the hierarchy of test cases and test suites, along with all the fixtures (global, case or
suite level), and the respective dependencies within all those elements.

A test tree is composed with:

* Test cases: those are the elements in the tree that contain the body of the tests, and they constitute
  the [*leaves] of the tree.
* Test suites: those are the are internal nodes of the tree. These elements that do not have any body or executable code themselves,
  but fixtures that execute code and tests can be attached to them.
* The master test suite: this is the root of the tree, and is by definition a test suite. Fixtures attached to the master test suite
  are [*global] fixtures.
* fixtures: those are units of code that are executed before and/or after the test units above.

The following hierarchy represents a test tree (further detailed in the [link boost_test.tests_organization.test_tree.test_suite test-suite]
section) [*without] any fixture:

[link boost_test.tests_organization.decorators Decoration] can be added to test suites and cases except for the master test suite. Those
decoration may modify the way the __UTF__
handles the tree. For instance, there is no defined order in the execution of test cases enforced by the tree itself, except for the fixtures
and the elements they relate to (suite, case); decoration may be used to instruct a specific order among the elements of the tree.

[note The test-tree by itself does not give any particular order in the execution of the test-cases. The only implicit order
 is given by the fixtures. To indicate a particular order, specific decorators should be used.]
