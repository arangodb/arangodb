[section:test_tree_content Test tree content]

The test module, and hence the test tree, should have at least one test-case scheduled for execution, otherwise the __UTF__
returns an error.

This check is performed *after* the filtering of the tests has occurred. The sections about
[link boost_test.tests_organization.enabling tests enabling/disabling], [link boost_test.tests_organization.tests_dependencies tests dependencies]
and [link boost_test.runtime_config.test_unit_filtering runtime filtering]
explain various methods that modify the tests that are being run.

[note A [link boost_test.tests_organization.fixtures.global global fixture] is not considered as a test case.]
