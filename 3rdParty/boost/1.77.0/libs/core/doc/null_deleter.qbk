[section Header <boost/core/null_deleter.hpp>]

The header `<boost/core/null_deleter.hpp>` defines the `boost::null_deleter` function object,
which can be used as a deleter with smart pointers such as `unique_ptr` or `shared_ptr`. The
deleter doesn't do anything with the pointer provided upon deallocation, which makes it useful
when the pointed object is deallocated elsewhere.

[section Example]
``
std::shared_ptr< std::ostream > make_stream()
{
    return std::shared_ptr< std::ostream >(&std::cout, boost::null_deleter());
}
``
