Quickbook documentation of Metaparse.

The getting_started_*.qbk files are automatically generated from the content of
getting_started.qbk. The header files of ../example/getting_started are also
automatically generated from getting_started.qbk.

These files can be regenerated by running

tools/generate_all.py

in the root directory of the Metaparse source code. Note that the script has
been tested on Linux only.
