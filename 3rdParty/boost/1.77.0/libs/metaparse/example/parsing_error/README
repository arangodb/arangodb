This example shows how a compile-time parsing error can be debugged.
The commented code fails to compile and on some platforms the error report might
be difficult to understand. This example demonstrates how debug_parsing_error
can be used to get a user friendly error report about such thing. You need to
run the compiled code to get the error message:

Compile-time parsing results
----------------------------
Input text:
aaac

Parsing failed:

The col and line information refers to the location of the error in the string
literal.
