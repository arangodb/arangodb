# Boost.GIL Legacy Tests

These are GIL's original, comprehensive, all-in-one test suits.

Rules of maintenance:

* Run the legacy tests as part of CI builds and regression tests.
* Keep as reference.
* Do NOT extend.
* Do NOT refactor.
* Modify ONLY if absolutely necessary (a bug found in the tests).

Add new test suites, with new test cases, even if their
functional coverage is the same as of the legacy tests.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md).
