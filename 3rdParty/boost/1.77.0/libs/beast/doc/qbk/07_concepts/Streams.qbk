[section:streams Streams]

A stream in the context of Beast and networking, represents a full-duplex
connection between two programs or hosts, where data represented as
bytes may be received reliably in the same order they were written.
Streams may support any combination of synchronous and/or asynchronous
reading and writing.

Stream concepts are based on named requirements in networking:
