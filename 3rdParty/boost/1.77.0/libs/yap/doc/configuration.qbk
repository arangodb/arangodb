[section Configuration]

_no_constexpr_if_m_ is a macro that indicates whether the compiler has support
for constexpr if.  It defaults to no.  Define it to be a nonzero value if your
compiler has constexpr if support.  Note that this is a temporary hack; this
should eventually be a Boost-wide macro.
