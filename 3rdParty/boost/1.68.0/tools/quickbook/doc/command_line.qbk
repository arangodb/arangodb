Quickbook is generally run by a build tool, but if you want to run it manually,
it's pretty simple to use. Basic usage is:

    quickbook filename.qbk

Which, if successful, will print out something like:

    Generating Output File: filename.xml

[section:options Command Line Options]

[variablelist
    [[--help] [
    Prints out a summary of the options supported by quickbook, and exits.
    ]]
    [[--version] [
    Prints out the version of the quickbook executable, and exists.
    ]]
    [[--no-pretty-print] [
    Disable XML pretty printing. Normally quickbook runs its output through
    a post processor which generates consistent XML indentation, this flag
    disables it.
    ]]
    [[--strict] [
    Strict mode. Adds extra errors for possible issues, including sections that
    weren't closed, and square brackets that don't match any tags or templates.
    ]]
    [[--no-self-linked-headers] [
    By default quickbook generates docbook headers that link to themselves,
    so that in a web browser you can get a link to the header by right clicking
    on the header and copying the link. This requires generating slightly odd
    boostbook markup, so this head disables the feature and generates plain headers.
    ]]
    [[--indent] [
    Indentation to use in the pretty printer.
    ]]
    [[--linewidth] [
    Line width to use in the pretty printer.
    ]]
    [[--input-file path] [
    Used to explicitly specify that the argument is an input file. Normally not used,
    as you can just write: ``quickbook filename.qbk``.
    But if you wish to you can also write: ``quickbook --input-file filename.qbk``.
    This could be useful if a file path could be confused with an option, for example
    to use a file called `--filename.qbk`:
    ``quickbook --input-file --filename.qbk``
    Only one input file can be specified.
    ]]
    [[--output-file path] [
    Explicitly specifiy the path of the file to be generated. By default, it's just the
    input file name with the extension replaced by `.xml`.
    ]]
    [[--no-output] [
    Don't write out a boostbook file. This is useful for checking that a
    document doesn't have any sytax errors, or for running with
    `--output-deps`. If `--output-file-path` is also defined, that overwrites
    this.
    ]]
    [[--output-deps path] [
    Writes the full path of all the files read in by quickbook to the given path.
    This is useful for build tools so that they can tell when to rebuild the
    documentation.
    ]]
    [[--ms-errors] [
    Use Microsoft Visual Studio style error and warn message format, so that
    Visual Studio IDE will understand them.
    ]]
    [[--include-path path, -I path] [
    Add the given path to the include path, can be specified multiple times.
    ]]
    [[--define macro, -D macro] [
    Define a quickbook macro. This can have a value: ``quickbook -D __foo__=bar``
    Or you can just define an empty macro: ``quickbook -D __foo__``
    This can be useful for [link quickbook.ref.cond conditional generation].
    ]]
    [[--image-location path] [
    Path the image elements are relative to. This is only used for reading
    in SVG details.
    ]]
