[section:InternetProtocol Internet protocol requirements]

A type `X` meets the `InternetProtocol` requirements if it satisfies the
requirements of [link boost_asio.reference.AcceptableProtocol `AcceptableProtocol`],

In the table below, `a` denotes a (possibly const) value of type `X`, and `b`
denotes a (possibly const) value of type `X`.
