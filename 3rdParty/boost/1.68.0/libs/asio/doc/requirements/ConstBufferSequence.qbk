[section:ConstBufferSequence Constant buffer sequence requirements]

A ['constant buffer sequence] represents a set of memory regions that may be
used as input to an operation, such as the `send` operation of a socket.

A type `X` meets the `ConstBufferSequence` requirements if it satisfies the
requirements of `Destructible` (C++Std [destructible]) and
`CopyConstructible` (C++Std [copyconstructible]), as well as the additional
requirements listed below.

In the table below, `x` denotes a (possibly const) value of type `X`, and `u`
denotes an identifier.
