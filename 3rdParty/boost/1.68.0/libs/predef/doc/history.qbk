[section History]

[heading 1.8]

* Add support for __ARM_ARCH macro. (from Tim Blechmann)
* Add detection for PTX architecture. (from Benjamin Worpitz)
* Add nvcc compiler detection. (from Benjamin Worpitz)
* Add support for detecting CUDA. (from Benjamin Worpitz)
* Remove reference to obsolete BOOST_ARCH_AMD64. (from Peter Kolbus)

[heading 1.7]

* Fix BOOST_ARCH_PARISK/BOOST_ARCH_PARISC typo.
* Improved Windows Universal Platform detection. (from James E. King, III)
* Add detection for CloudABI with cloudlibc. (from James E. King, III)

[heading 1.6]

* Fix Intel C/C++ version 9999 detection to be 12.1.0.
* Addition of `BOOST_PREDEF_WORKAROUND` and `BOOST_PREDEF_TESTED_AT` macros
  for defect workarounds and detection.
* Add ARM64 MSVC SIMD detection. (from Minmin Gong)
* Add detection of iOS simulator vs device as a platform choice. (from Ruslan
  Baratov)
* Fix MinGW incorrect header guard. (from Ruslan Baratov)

[heading 1.5]

* Fix Intel C/C++ compiler version specification.
* Add `BOOST_VERSION_NUMBER_MAJOR`, `BOOST_VERSION_NUMBER_MINOR`,
  `BOOST_VERSION_NUMBER_PATCH` macros to extract components from valid version
  numbers.
* Change VS version numbering. Version after VS2015 will use the compiler
  version instead of the varied product versions.

[heading 1.4.1]

* Small fixes for some redefinition errors, and mispelled macros.
* Slightly rearrangement of structure to comply with current library requirements.

[heading 1.4]

* Add detection of SIMD hardware. With the addition of the `BOOST_HW_*`
  category (from Charly Chevalier).
* Add compile only version of check utilities to address cross-compile
  use cases. And changed the BBv2 check support to use compile only checks.
* Fix test warnings.
* Fix typos on `AVAILABLE` macros for Windows Platform. (from Vemund Handeland)

[heading 1.3]

* Fix many problems with `predef_check` functionality.
* Update SunPro detection to accomodate latest version of compiler from Oracle.
* Addition of Travis-CI and Appveyor testing.
* Add `and` and `or` logical operators for `predef_check` expression on the Boost Build side.
* Fix `BOOST_ARCH_PARISC` to correctly spelled name (from Graham Hanson).
* Fix `MAKE_YYYYM` macros to correctly limit the month (from rick68).

[heading 1.2]

* Account for skip in Visual Studio product version vs. compiler version.
  This supports version of VS 2015 an onward.
* Add detection of Haiku OS (from Jessica Hamilton).
* Some fixes to endian detection for Android (from mstahl-at-redhat.com).
* Add missing `BOOST_PREDEF_MAKE_0X_VVRRPP` macro (from Erik Lindahl).
* Add `predef_check` program and BBv2 integration for build configuration
  checks.

[heading 1.1]

* Addition of `BOOST_PLAT_*` platform definitions for MinGW and
  Windows platform variants.
* Detection of ARM architecture for Windows compilers to target
  mobile devices of Windows 8.
* Improved ARM detection for 64 bit ARM.
* Added detection of iOS an an operating system.
* Improved detection of endianess on some platforms.
* Addition of exclusive plus emulated definitions for platform
  and compiler detection.

[warning The big change for this version is the restructuring of the
definitions to avoid duplicate definitions in one category. That is, only one
`BOOST_OS_*`, `BOOST_COMP_*`, and `BOOST_PLAT_*` variant will be detected
(except for sub-categories).]
