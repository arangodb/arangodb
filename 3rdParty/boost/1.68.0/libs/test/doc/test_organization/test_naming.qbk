[section:test_naming Tests naming]
The __UTF__ is flexible on how naming the test units (test cases/suites) and
it is possible to use a wide variety of characters. However there are scenarios
where the name of a test unit may collide with other and remote functionalities 
of the __UTF__. For instance:

* a character may collide with specific command line filters for selecting a 
  subset of the test tree. Among those characters: `'@'`, `'+'` or `'/'` 
  (see [link boost_test.runtime_config.test_unit_filtering this section] for 
  more details)
* a name containing a character that is reserved for the shell/terminal, such as
  '!', '\*' ..., may prevent the test name to be passed on the command line *as is*.

To prevent any conflicting declaration, the __UTF__ *sanitizes* the name given to
a test unit (case or suite), prior to adding the test to the test tree. Any 
conflicting character is replaced by an underscore `'_'`. 

[note [*Spaces] are not considered as /special chars/ and are preserved, except for the 
 leading and trailing spaces which are removed.]

[note The sanitization of the test unit names has been introduced in [link ref_CHANGE_LOG_3_7 Boost 1.67].
