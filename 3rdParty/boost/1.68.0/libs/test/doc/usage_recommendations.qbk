[#ref_usage_recommendations][section Practical usage recommendations]

Following pages present tips and recommendations on how to use and apply the __UTF__ in your real life practice.
You don't necessarily need to follow them, but we found them handy.

Here you will also find some tutorials from Boost.Test authors and world wide.

[section General]

[h4 Prefer offline compiled libraries to the inline included components]
If you are just want to write quick simple test in environment where you never used Boost.Test before - yes,
use included components. But if you plan to use Boost.Test on permanent basis, small investment of time needed
to build (if not build yet), install and change you makefiles/project settings will soon return to you in a
form of shorter compilation time. Why do you need to make your compiler do the same work over and over again?

[h4 If you use only free function based test cases advance to the automatic registration facility]
It's really easy to switch to automatic registration. And you don't need to worry about forgotten test cases.

[h4 To find location of first error reported by test tool within reused template function, use special hook within framework headers]
In some cases you are reusing the same template based code from within one test case (actually we recommend
better solution in such case - see below). Now if an error gets reported by the test tool within that reused
code you may have difficulty locating were exactly error occurred. To address this issue you could either a add
__BOOST_TEST_MESSAGE__ statements in templated code that log current type id of template parameters or you can use special hook located in
`unit_test_result.hpp` called `first_failed_assertion()`. If you set a breakpoint right on the line where this
function is defined you will be able to unroll the stack and see where error actually occurred.


[h4 To test reusable template base component with different template parameter use test case template facility]
If you writing unit test for generic reusable component you may have a need to test it against set of different
template parameter types . Most probably you will end up with a code like this:

``
template<typename TestType>
void specific_type_test( TestType* = 0 )
{
  MyComponent<TestType> c;
  // ... here we perform actual testing
}

void my_component_test()
{
  specific_type_test( (int*)0 );
  specific_type_test( (float*)0 );
  specific_type_test( (UDT*)0 );
  // ...
}
``

This is namely the situation where you would use test case template facility. It not only simplifies this kind
of unit testing by automating some of the work, in addition every argument type gets tested separately under
unit test monitor. As a result if one of types produce exception or non-fatal error you may still continue and
get results from testing with other types.

[section IDE usage recommendations]

This recommendation is shown using Microsoft Visual Studio as an example, but you can apply similar steps in
different IDEs.

[h4 Use custom build step to automatically start test program after compilation]
I found it most convenient to put test program execution as a post-build step in compilation. To do so use
project property page:

[$images/post_build_event.jpg]

Full command you need in "Command Line" field is:

[pre
"$(TargetDir)\$(TargetName).exe" --[link boost_test.utf_reference.rt_param_reference.result_code `result_code`]=no --[link boost_test.utf_reference.rt_param_reference.report_level `report_level`]=no
]

Note that both report level and result code are suppressed. This way the only output you may see from this
command are possible runtime errors. But the best part is that you could jump through these errors using usual
keyboard shortcuts/mouse clicks you use for compilation error analysis:

[$images/post_build_out.jpg]

[h4 If you got fatal exception somewhere within test case, make debugger break at the point the failure by adding
    extra command line argument]

If you got "memory access violation" message (or any other message indication fatal or system error) when you
run you test, to get more information of error location add

[pre
--[link boost_test.utf_reference.rt_param_reference.catch_system catch_system_error]=no
]
to the test run command line:

[$images/run_args.jpg]

Now run the test again under debugger and it will break at the point of failure.

[endsect] [/ IDE]

[section Command line usage recommendations]

[h4 If you got fatal exception somewhere within test case, make program generate coredump by adding extra command
      line argument]
If you got "memory access violation" message (or any other message indication fatal or system error) when you
run you test, to get more information about the error location add

[pre
--[link boost_test.utf_reference.rt_param_reference.catch_system catch_system_error]=no
]

to the test run command line. Now run the test again and it will create a coredump you could analyze using you preferable
debugger. Or run it under debugger in a first place and it will break at the point of failure.

[h4 How to use test module build with Boost.Test framework under management of automated regression test facilities?]

My first recommendation is to make sure that the test framework catches all fatal errors by adding argument

[pre
--[link boost_test.utf_reference.rt_param_reference.catch_system catch_system_error]=yes
]

to all test modules invocations. Otherwise test program may produce unwanted dialogs (depends on compiler and OS) that will halt you
regression tests run. The second recommendation is to suppress result report output by adding

[pre
--[link boost_test.utf_reference.rt_param_reference.report_level report_level]=no
]

argument and test log output by adding

[pre
--[link boost_test.utf_reference.rt_param_reference.log_level log_level]=nothing
]

argument, so that test module won't produce undesirable output no one is going to look at
anyway. We recommend relying only on result code that will be consistent for all test programs. An
alternative to my second recommendation is direct both log and report to separate file you could analyze
later on. Moreover you can  make Boost.Test to produce them in XML or JUNIT format using

[pre
--[link boost_test.utf_reference.rt_param_reference.output_format output_format]=XML
]
or
[pre
--[link boost_test.utf_reference.rt_param_reference.log_format log_format]=JUNIT
]

and use some automated tool that will format this information as you like.
