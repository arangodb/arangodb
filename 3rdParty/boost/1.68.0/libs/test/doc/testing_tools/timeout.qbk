[section:timeout Time-out for test cases]

The __UTF__ provides the decorator __decorator_timeout__ that specifies a time-out for a specific *test case*, 
The argument time (in seconds) sets the maximum allowed duration of a test case. If this time is 
exceeded the test case is forced to stop and is reported as failure.

[bt_example decorator_11..decorator timeout..run-fail]

[note Applied at test suite level, this decorator has no effect.]

[caution Decorator `timeout` has no effect on Windows build. This feature is not implemented on Windows yet.]
