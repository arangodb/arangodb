[section:strings Strings and C-strings comparison]
In the general case, pointers are compared using their value. However when type of the the pointers are `char*` or `wchar_t*`,
__BOOST_TEST__ promotes them as null terminated `char` arrays and string comparison is used instead.
`std::string` (or any `std::basic_string`) is eligible for string comparison.

String comparison can be used only if the the operands to compare in __BOOST_TEST__ can both be considered as strings type.

[tip In this form, the comparison method and reporting can be overridden an additional argument to __BOOST_TEST__.
 See the [link boost_test.testing_tools.extended_comparison.collections collection comparison] section for more details, in particular
 `boost::test_tools::per_element()` and `boost::test_tools::lexicographic()` modifiers.]
