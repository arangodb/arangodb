<h1>Endian Library TODO List</h1>

<h2>To Do</h2>
<h2>Format Review Comments</h2>
<h3 dir="ltr">Interesting</h3>
<ul>
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p dir="ltr">John Filo - &quot;Absolutely. I'd like to see support for float and 
  double, but<br>
  even without those additions, I still vote yes.&quot; &quot;For those who deal with 
  non-native endian data, this library is<br>
  extremely useful. It automatically eliminates a whole class of common<br>
  programming errors when dealing with such data.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p dir="ltr">Hartmut Kaiser - &quot;Even if this is not a full review, I would like 
  to vote YES to include this <br>
  library into Boost. 
  <p>Boost.Spirit is using (and shipping) with an older version of this library
  <br>
  for several years now and we never had any problems with its usage in <br>
  Spirit. It is used as the underlying framework for the binary parsers and <br>
  generators and it is functioning as advertised.</p>
  <p>As a quick test I replaced the internal (older) version of Boost.Endian in
  <br>
  Spirit with the reviewed version. All of Spirits regression tests still <br>
  pass. &quot;<br>
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Executive summary</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Common use case scenarios should be developed.</li>
  <li>Example programs should be developed for the common use case scenarios.</li>
  <li>Documentation should illuminate the differences between endian 
  integer/float type and endian conversion approaches to the common use case 
  scenarios, and provide guidelines for choosing the most appropriate approach 
  for user's applications.</li>
  <li>Conversion functions supplying results via <code>return</code> should be 
  provided.</li>
  <li>Platform specific performance enhancements such as use of compiler 
  intrinsics or relaxed alignment requirements should be supported.</li>
  <li>Endian integer (and floating) types should be implemented via the 
  conversion functions. If that can't be done efficiently, consideration should 
  be given to expanding the conversion function signatures to resolve the 
  inefficiencies.</li>
  <li>Benchmarks that measure performance should be provided. It should be 
  possible to compare platform specific performance enhancements against 
  portable base implementations, and to compare endian integer approaches 
  against endian conversion approaches for the common use case scenarios.</li>
  <li>Float (32-bits) and double (64-bits) should be supported. IEEE 754 is the 
  primary use case.</li>
  <li>Support for user defined types (UDTs) is desirable, and should be 
  supported where there would be no conflict with the other concerns.</li>
  <li>There is some concern that endian integer/float arithmetic operations 
  might used 
  inadvertently or inappropriately. The impact of adding an endian_buffer class without arithmetic 
  operations should be investigated.</li>
  <li>Stream insertion and extraction of the endian integer/float types should 
  be documented and included in the test coverage.</li>
  <li>Binary I/O support that was investigated during development of the Endian 
  library should be put up for min-review for inclusion in the Boost I/O 
  library.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Docs</h3>
<ul>
  <li>one other point ... the help file seems to directly link to the c++ 
  headers.<br>
  this should be changed:<br>
  <br>
  * some browsers (at least chromium) will not display the header when clicking<br>
  &nbsp;the link, but will save them on disk.<br>
  <br>
  * providing a direct link to the source code from the docs implies that the<br>
  &nbsp;user will get some information that are necessary to use the library by<br>
  &nbsp;reading the sources. imo, this is not the case for using boost.endian.<br>
  <br>
  * if a user opens integer.hpp, the first 60 lines just contain copyright, some<br>
  &nbsp;historical notes, compiler-specific stuff, includes and ifdefs. imo, this is<br>
  &nbsp;the implementation part, which should not be exposed to a user.<br>
  <br>
  so i'd suggest to completely remove the links to the c++ headers.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
