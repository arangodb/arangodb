<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>Deciding which is the best endianness approach (conversion functions, buffer 
types, or arithmetic types) for a particular application involves complex 
engineering trade-offs. It is hard to assess those trade-offs without some 
understanding of the different interfaces, so you might want to read the
<a href="conversion.html">conversion functions</a>, <a href="buffers.html">
buffer types</a>, and <a href="arithmetic.html">arithmetic types</a> pages 
before diving into this page.</p>

<h2><a name="Choosing">Choosing</a> between  conversion functions,  buffer types, 
and  arithmetic types</h2>

<p>The best approach to endianness for a particular application  depends on  the interaction between 
the application&#39;s needs and the characteristics of each of the three  approaches.</p>

<p><b>Recommendation:</b> If you are new to endianness, uncertain, or don&#39;t want to invest 
the time to 
study 
engineering trade-offs, use <a href="arithmetic.html">endian arithmetic types</a>. They are safe, easy 
to use, and easy to maintain. Use the
<a href="#Anticipating-need"> <i>
anticipating need</i></a> design pattern locally around performance hot spots 
like lengthy loops, if needed.</p>

<h3><a name="Background">Background</a> </h3>

<p>A dealing with endianness usually implies a program portability or a data 
portability requirement, and often both. That means real programs dealing with 
endianness are usually complex, so the examples shown here would really be 
written as multiple functions spread across multiple translation units. They 
would involve interfaces that can not be altered as they are supplied by 
third-parties or the standard library. </p>

<h3><a name="Characteristics">Characteristics</a></h3>

<p>The characteristics that differentiate the three approaches to endianness are the endianness 
invariants, conversion explicitness, arithmetic operations, sizes available, and 
alignment requirements.</p>

<h4><a name="Endianness-invariants">Endianness invariants</a></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Endian conversion functions</b> use objects of the ordinary C++ arithmetic 
types like <code>int</code> or <code>unsigned short</code> to hold values. That 
breaks the implicit invariant that the C++ language rules apply. The usual 
language rules only apply if the endianness of the object is currently set to the native endianness for the platform. That can 
make it very hard to reason about logic flow, and result in difficult to 
find bugs.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>struct data_t  // big endian
{
  int32_t   v1;  // description ...
  int32_t   v2;  // description ...
  ... additional character data members (i.e. non-endian)
  int32_t   v3;  // description ...
};

data_t data;

read(data);
big_to_native_inplace(data.v1);
big_to_native_inplace(data.v2);

... 

++v1;
third_party::func(data.v2);

... 

native_to_big_inplace(data.v1);
native_to_big_inplace(data.v2);
write(data);
</pre>
  <p>The programmer didn&#39;t bother to convert <code>data.v3</code> to native 
  endianness because that member isn&#39;t used. A later maintainer needs to pass
  <code>data.v3</code> to the third-party function, so adds <code>third_party::func(data.v3);</code> 
  somewhere deep in the code. This causes a silent failure because the usual 
  invariant that an object of type <code>int32_t</code> holds a value as 
  described by the C++ core language does not apply.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Endian buffer and arithmetic types</b> hold values internally as arrays of 
characters with an invariant that the endianness of the array never changes. 
That makes these types easier to use and programs easier to maintain. </p>
<p>Here is the same example, using an endian arithmetic type:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>struct data_t
{
  big_int32_t   v1;  // description ...
  big_int32_t   v2;  // description ...
  ... additional character data members (i.e. non-endian)
  big_int32_t   v3;  // description ...
};

data_t data;

read(data);

... 

++v1;
third_party::func(data.v2);

... 

write(data);
</pre>
  <p>A later maintainer can add <code>third_party::func(data.v3)</code>and it 
  will just-work.</p>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>

<h4><a name="Conversion-explicitness">Conversion explicitness</a></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Endian conversion functions</b> and <b>buffer types</b> never perform 
implicit conversions. This gives users explicit control of when conversion 
occurs, and may help avoid unnecessary conversions.</p>

<p><b>Endian arithmetic types</b> perform conversion implicitly. That makes 
these types very easy to use, but can result in unnecessary conversions. Failure 
to hoist conversions out of inner loops can bring a performance penalty.</p>

</blockquote>

<h4><a name="Arithmetic-operations">Arithmetic operations</a></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Endian conversion functions</b> do not supply arithmetic 
operations, but this is not a concern since this approach uses ordinary C++ 
arithmetic types to hold values.</p>

<p><b>Endian buffer types</b> do not supply arithmetic operations. Although this 
approach avoids unnecessary conversions, it can result in the introduction of 
additional variables and confuse maintenance programmers.</p>

<p><b>Endian</b> <b>arithmetic types</b> do supply arithmetic operations. They 
are very easy to use if lots of arithmetic is involved. </p>

</blockquote>

<h4><a name="Sizes">Sizes</a></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Endianness conversion functions</b> only support 1, 2, 4, and 8 byte 
integers. That&#39;s sufficient for many applications.</p>

<p><b>Endian buffer and arithmetic types</b> support 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 
byte integers. For an application where memory use or I/O speed is the limiting 
factor, using sizes tailored to application needs can be  useful.</p>

</blockquote>

<h4><a name="Alignments">Alignments</a></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Endianness conversion functions</b> only support aligned integer and 
floating-point types. That&#39;s sufficient for most applications.</p>

<p><b>Endian buffer and arithmetic types</b> support both aligned and unaligned 
integer and floating-point types. Unaligned types are rarely needed, but when 
needed they are often very useful and workarounds are painful. For example,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Non-portable code like this:<blockquote>
      <pre>struct S {
  uint16_t a;&nbsp; // big endian
  uint32_t b;&nbsp; // big endian
} __attribute__ ((packed));</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Can be replaced with portable code like this:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>struct S {
  big_uint16_ut a;
  big_uint32_ut b;
};</pre>
    </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

</blockquote>

<h3><a name="Design-patterns">Design patterns</a></h3>

<p>Applications often traffic in endian data as records or packets containing 
multiple endian data elements. For simplicity, we will just call them records.</p>

<p>If desired endianness differs from native endianness, a conversion has to be 
performed. When should that conversion occur? Three design patterns have 
evolved.</p>

<h4><a name="As-needed">Convert only as needed</a> (i.e. lazy)</h4>

<p>This pattern defers conversion to the point in the code where the data 
element is actually used.</p>

<p>This pattern is appropriate when which endian element is actually used varies 
greatly according to record content or other circumstances</p>

<h4><a name="Anticipating-need">Convert in anticipation of need</a></h4>

<p>This pattern performs conversion to native endianness in anticipation of use, 
such as immediately after reading records. If needed, conversion to the output 
endianness is performed after all possible needs have passed, such as just 
before writing records.</p>

<p>One implementation of this pattern is to create a proxy record with 
endianness converted to native in a read function, and expose only that proxy to 
the rest of the implementation. If a write function, if needed, handles the 
conversion from native to the desired output endianness.</p>

<p>This pattern is appropriate when all endian elements in a record are 
typically used regardless of record content or other circumstances</p>

<h4><a name="Convert-generally-as-needed-locally-in-anticipation">Convert 
only as needed, except locally in anticipation of need</a></h4>

<p>This pattern in general defers conversion but for specific local needs does 
anticipatory conversion. Although particularly appropriate when coupled with the endian buffer 
or arithmetic types, it also works well with the conversion functions.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>struct data_t
{
  big_int32_t   v1;
  big_int32_t   v2;
  big_int32_t   v3;
};

data_t data;

read(data);

...
++v1;
...

int32_t v3_temp = data.v3;  // hoist conversion out of loop

for (int32_t i = 0; i &lt; <i><b>large-number</b></i>; ++i)
{
  ... <i><b>lengthy computation that accesses </b></i>v3_temp<i><b> many times</b></i> ...
}
data.v3 = v3_temp; 

write(data);
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p dir="ltr">In general the above pseudo-code leaves conversion up to the endian 
arithmetic type <code>big_int32_t</code>. But to avoid conversion inside the 
loop, a temporary is created before the loop is entered, and then used to set 
the new value of <code>data.v3</code> after the loop is complete.</p>

<blockquote>

<p dir="ltr">Question: Won&#39;t the compiler&#39;s optimizer hoist the conversion out 
of the loop anyhow?</p>

<p dir="ltr">Answer: VC++ 2015 Preview, and probably others, does not, even for 
a toy test program. Although the savings is small (two register <code>
<span style="font-size: 85%">bswap</span></code> instructions), the cost might 
be significant if the loop is repeated enough times. On the other hand, the 
program may be so dominated by I/O time that even a lengthy loop will be 
immaterial.</p>

</blockquote>

<h3><a name="Use-cases">Use case examples</a></h3>

<h4><a name="Porting-endian-unaware-codebase">Porting endian unaware codebase</a></h4>

<p>An existing codebase runs on  big endian systems. It does not 
currently deal with endianness. The codebase needs to be modified so it can run 
on&nbsp; little endian systems under various operating systems. To ease 
transition and protect value of existing files, external data will continue to 
be maintained as big endian.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The <a href="arithmetic.html">endian 
arithmetic approach</a> is recommended to meet these needs. A relatively small 
number of header files dealing with binary I/O layouts need to change types. For 
example,&nbsp;
<code>short</code> or <code>int16_t</code> would change to <code>big_int16_t</code>. No 
changes are required for <code>.cpp</code> files.</p>

<h4><a name="Porting-endian-aware-codebase">Porting endian aware codebase</a></h4>

<p>An existing codebase runs on little-endian Linux systems. It already 
deals with endianness via
<a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/endian.3.html">Linux provided 
functions</a>. Because of a business merger, the codebase has to be quickly 
modified for Windows and possibly other operating systems, while still 
supporting Linux. The codebase is reliable and the programmers are all 
well-aware of endian issues. </p>

<p dir="ltr">These factors all argue for an <a href="conversion.html">endian conversion 
approach</a> that just mechanically changes the calls to <code>htobe32</code>, 
etc. to <code>boost::endian::native_to_big</code>, etc. and replaces <code>&lt;endian.h&gt;</code> 
with <code>&lt;boost/endian/conversion.hpp&gt;</code>.</p>

<h4><a name="Reliability-arithmetic-speed">Reliability and arithmetic-speed</a></h4>

<p>A new, complex, multi-threaded application is to be developed that must run 
on little endian machines, but do big endian network I/O. The developers believe 
computational speed for endian variable is critical but have seen numerous bugs 
result from inability to reason about endian conversion state. They are also 
worried that future maintenance changes could inadvertently introduce a lot of 
slow conversions if full-blown endian arithmetic types are used.</p>

<p>The <a href="buffers.html">endian buffers</a> approach is made-to-order for 
this use case.</p>

<h4><a name="Reliability-ease-of-use">Reliability and ease-of-use</a></h4>

<p>A new, complex, multi-threaded application is to be developed that must run 
on little endian machines, but do big endian network I/O. The developers believe 
computational speed for endian variables is <b>not critical</b> but have seen 
numerous bugs result from inability to reason about endian conversion state. 
They are also concerned about ease-of-use both during development and long-term 
maintenance.</p>

<p>Removing concern about conversion speed and adding concern about ease-of-use 
tips the balance strongly in favor the <a href="arithmetic.html">endian 
arithmetic approach</a>.</p>
