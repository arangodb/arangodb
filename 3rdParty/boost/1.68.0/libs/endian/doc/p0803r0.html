<h1 align="center">Endian Library Request for Comments (R0)</h1>


<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The Boost Endian library manipulates the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">endianness</a> of integers 
and user-defined types. It provides three approaches to dealing with endianness: 
conversion functions, buffer classes, and  arithmetic classes. Each approach 
has use cases where it is preferred over the other approaches. The purpose of 
this RFC is to determine interest in adding all or any of these components to 
the C++ standard library or a library TS.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Boost Endian documentation (<a href="https://www.boost.org/libs/endian/doc/index.html">www.boost.org/libs/endian/doc</a>) 
provides an <a href="https://www.boost.org/libs/endian/doc/index.html">overview</a> 
and detailed technical specifications for the
<a href="https://www.boost.org/libs/endian/doc/conversion.html">conversion 
functions</a>, <a href="https://www.boost.org/libs/endian/doc/arithmetic.html">
arithmetic types</a>, and
<a href="https://www.boost.org/libs/endian/doc/buffers.html">buffer types</a>.
</p>
<p>A separate discussion covers
<a href="https://www.boost.org/libs/endian/doc/choosing_approach.html">choosing 
between the three approaches</a> provided by the library.</p>
<p>For those not interested in plowing through the entire documentation, the
<a href="https://www.boost.org/libs/endian/doc/index.html#FAQ">Overall FAQ</a>,
<a href="https://www.boost.org/libs/endian/doc/conversion.html#FAQ">Conversion 
FAQ</a>, <a href="https://www.boost.org/libs/endian/doc/arithmetic.html#FAQ">
Arithmetic FAQ</a>, and
<a href="https://www.boost.org/libs/endian/doc/buffers.html#FAQ">Buffers FAQ</a> 
answer a lot of question likely to arise during standardization.</p>
<h2>Motivation for standardization</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Lack of any one de facto standard endianness capability in either C or 
  C++. While most platforms provides some way to handle endianness in C, the 
  mechanism varies from platform to platform.</li>
  <li>Commonly used endian handling functions are extremely error prone. While 
  the Boost Endian conversion functions have the same problems, the buffer and 
  arithmetic classes do not.</li>
  <li>Surprisingly difficult to write and test yourself in a portable yet 
  efficient (i.e. using intrinsics) way. </li>
  <li>Explicit requests for standardization from Boost Endian users.</li>
  <li>The Boost library is existing practice with years of both implementation 
  and end-user experience.</li>
  <li>The committee has already failed once to standardize endian conversion 
  functions; perhaps now is time to do it right.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Impact on the standard library</h2>
<p>All three proposed approaches to endianness would be a pure additions to the 
standard library and would break no existing user code (modulo the usual 
namespace caveats).</p>
<h2>Proposed wording</h2>
<p>The Boost Endian reference documentation for
<a href="https://www.boost.org/libs/endian/doc/conversion.html#Reference">
Conversion</a>,
<a href="https://www.boost.org/libs/endian/doc/arithmetic.html#endian">
Arithmetic</a>, and
<a href="https://www.boost.org/libs/endian/doc/buffers.html#endian">Buffer</a> 
approaches follows the standard library&#39;s <i>Method of description</i> 
[description], so provides a fairly close approximation of what proposed wording 
would look like. Actual proposed wording will be provided in a proposal document 
for any portions of the library of interest to the committee. Names will need 
the usual bikeshedding.</p>
<h2>Questions for the Library Evolution Group</h2>
<ul>
  <li>How would you likely vote on a fully-worded and reviewed proposal to add a 
  standardized version of the Boost Endian conversion functions to the standard 
  library or a library TS?<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>How would you likely vote on a fully-worded and reviewed proposal to add a 
  standardized version of the Boost Endian buffer classes to the standard 
  library or a library TS?<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>How would you likely vote on a fully-worded and reviewed proposal to add a 
  standardized version of the Boost Endian arithmetic classes to the standard 
  library or a library TS?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>The original design for the arithmetic classes was developed by Darin Adler 
based on work by Mark Borgerding. The Boost documentation acknowledges

other people</a>.</p>
