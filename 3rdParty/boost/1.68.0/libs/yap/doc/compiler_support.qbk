[section Compiler Support]

_yap_ is written against the C++14 and C++17 standards.  It will use C++17
features if they are present, and otherwise is C++14 code.

_yap_ also uses Boost.Hana extensively, so only compilers that support Hana
will be usable in building _yap_.

Clang versions 3.8 and later (which corresponds to XCode versions 7.3 or
later), and GCC versions 6 and later should work.

At the time of this writing, no version of MSVC's own C++ front-end (cl.exe)
supports either set of requirements above, though the clang-cl and Clang/C2
compilers for Windows should work fine.
