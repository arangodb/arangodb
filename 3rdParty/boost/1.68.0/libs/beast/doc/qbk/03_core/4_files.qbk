[section Files]

Often when implementing network algorithms such as servers, it is necessary
to interact with files on the system. Beast defines the __File__ concept
and several models to facilitate cross-platform interaction with the
underlying filesystem:

[table File Types
[[Name][Description]]
[[
    [link beast.ref.boost__beast__file `file`]
][
    `file` is a type alias to one of the following implementations,
    depending on what is available on the target platform.
]]
[[
    [link beast.ref.boost__beast__file_stdio `file_stdio`]
][
    This implementation of __File__ uses the C++ standard library
    facilities obtained by including `<cstdio>`.
]]
[[
    [link beast.ref.boost__beast__file_win32 `file_win32`]
][
    This implements a __File__ for the Win32 API. It provides low level
    access to the native file handle when necessary.
]]
[[
    [link beast.ref.boost__beast__file_posix `file_posix`]
][
    For POSIX systems, this class provides a suitable implementation
    of __File__ which wraps the native file descriptor and provides
    it if necessary.
]]
