[section Asio Refresher]

[warning
    Beast does not manage sockets, make outgoing connections,
    accept incoming connections, handle timeouts, close endpoints,
    do name lookups, deal with TLS certificates, perform authentication,
    or otherwise handle any aspect of connection management. This is
    left to the interfaces already existing on the underlying streams.
]

Library stream algorithms require a __socket__, __ssl_stream__, or other
__Stream__ object that has already established communication with an
endpoint. This example is provided as a reminder of how to work with
sockets:
