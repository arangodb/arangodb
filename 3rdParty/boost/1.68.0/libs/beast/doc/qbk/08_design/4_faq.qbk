[section FAQ]

To set realistic expectations and prevent a litany of duplicate review
statements, these notes address the most common questions and comments
about Beast and other HTTP libraries that have gone through formal review.

[variablelist
[[
    "Beast requires too much user code to do anything!"
][
    It is not the intention of the library to provide turn-key
    solutions for specific HTTP or WebSocket use-cases.
    Instead, it is a sensible protocol layering on top of
    Boost.Asio which retains the Boost.Asio memory
    management style and asynchronous model. 
]]
[[
    "Beast does not offer an HTTP server?"
][
    Beast has a functional HTTP server in the example directory. The
    server supports both HTTP and WebSocket using synchronous and
    asynchronous shared or dedicated ports. In addition, the server
    supports encrypted TLS connections if OpenSSL is available, on
    dedicated ports. And the server comes with a "multi-port", a
    flexible single port which supports both encrypted and unencrypted
    connections, both HTTP and WebSocket, all on the same port. The
    server is not part of Beast's public interfaces, as that
    functionality is outside the scope of the library. The author
    feels that attempting to broaden the scope of the library will
    reduce its appeal for standardization.
]]
[[
    "Beast does not offer an HTTP client?"
][
    "I just want to download a resource using HTTP" is a common
    cry from users and reviewers. Such functionality is beyond
    the scope of Beast. Building a full featured HTTP client is
    a difficult task and large enough to deserve its own library.
    There are many things to deal with such as the various message
    body encodings, complex parsing of headers, difficult header
    semantics such as Range and Cache-Control, redirection,
    Expect:100-continue, connection retrying, domain name
    resolution, TLS, and much, much more. It is the author's
    position that Boost first needs a common set of nouns and
    verbs for manipulating HTTP at the protocol level; Beast
    provides that language.
]]
[[
    "There's no HTTP/2 support yet!"
][
    Many reviewers feel that HTTP/2 support is an essential feature of
    a HTTP library. The authors agree that HTTP/2 is important but also
    feel that the most sensible implementation is one that does not re-use
    the same network reading and writing interface for 2 as that for 1.0
    and 1.1.

    The Beast HTTP message model was designed with the new protocol
    in mind and should be evaluated in that context. There are plans
    to add HTTP/2 in the future, but there is no rush to do so.
    Users can work with HTTP/1 now; we should not deny them that
    functionality today to wait for a newer protocol tomorrow.
    It is the author's position that there is sufficient value in
    Beast's HTTP/1-only implementation that the lack of HTTP/2
    should not be a barrier to acceptance.

    The Beast HTTP message model is suitable for HTTP/2 and can be re-used.
    The IETF HTTP Working Group adopted message compatibility with HTTP/1.x
    as an explicit goal. A parser can simply emit full headers after
    decoding the compressed HTTP/2 headers. The stream ID is not logically
    part of the message but rather message metadata and should be
    communicated out-of-band (see below). HTTP/2 sessions begin with a
    traditional HTTP/1.1 Upgrade similar in fashion to the WebSocket
    upgrade. An HTTP/2 implementation can use existing Beast.HTTP primitives
    to perform this handshake.
]]
[[
    "This should work with standalone-Asio!"
][
    Beast uses more than Boost.Asio, it depends on various other parts
    of Boost. The standalone Asio is currently farther ahead than the
    Boost version. Keeping Beast maintained against both versions of
    Asio is beyond the resources of the author at the present time.
    Compatibility with non-Boost libraries should not be an acceptance
    criteria. Beast is currently designed to be a part of Boost:
    nothing more, nothing less. Looking at the bigger picture, it
    is the author's goal to propose this library for standardization.
    A logical track for achieving this is as follows:

    [ordered_list
    [
        Boost library acceptance.
    ][
        Port to the Boost.Asio version of Networking-TS (This has to wait
        until Boost's version of Asio is updated).
    ][
        Wait for Networking-TS to become an official part of C++.
    ][
        Port to the standard library versions of networking (gcc, clang, msvc).
    ][
        Develop proposed language (This can happen concurrently with steps 3 and 4)
    ]]
]]
[[
    "You need benchmarks!"
][
    The energy invested in Beast went into the design of the interfaces,
    not performance. That said, the most sensitive parts of Beast have
    been optimized or designed with optimization in mind. The slow parts
    of WebSocket processing have been optimized, and the HTTP parser design
    is lifted from another extremely popular project which has performance
    as a design goal (see [@https://github.com/h2o/picohttpparser]).

    From: [@http://www.boost.org/development/requirements.html]

        "Aim first for clarity and correctness; optimization should
         be only a secondary concern in most Boost libraries."

    As the library matures it will undergo optimization passes; benchmarks
    will logically accompany this process. There is a small benchmarking
    program included in the tests which compares the performance of
    Beast's parser to the NodeJS reference parser, as well as some
    benchmarks which compare the performance of various Beast dynamic
    buffer implementations against Asio's.

[[
    "Beast is a terrible name!"
][
    The name "Boost.Http" or "Boost.WebSocket" would mislead users into
    believing they could perform an HTTP request on a URL or put up a
    WebSocket client or server in a couple of lines of code. Where
    would the core utilities go? Very likely it would step on the
    owner of Boost.Asio's toes to put things in the boost/asio 
    directory; at the very least, it would create unrequested,
    additional work for the foreign repository.
    
    "Beast" is sufficiently vague as to not suggest any particular
    functionality, while acting as a memorable umbrella term for a
    family of low level containers and algorithms. People in the know
    or with a need for low-level network protocol operations will
    have no trouble finding it, and the chances of luring a novice
    into a bad experience are greatly reduced.
    There is precedent for proper names: "Hana", "Fusion", "Phoenix",
    and "Spirit" come to mind. Is "Beast" really any worse than say,
    "mp11" for example?
    Beast also already has a growing body of users and attention from
    the open source community, the name Beast comes up in reddit posts
    and StackOverflow as the answer to questions about which HTTP or
    WebSocket library to use.

[[
    "Some more advanced examples, e.g. including TLS with client/server
    certificates would help."
][
    The server-framework example demonstrates how to implement a server
    that supports TLS using certificates. There are also websocket and
    HTTP client examples which use TLS. Furthermore, management of
    certificates is beyond the scope of the public interfaces of the
    library. Asio already provides documentation, interfaces, and
    examples for performing these tasks - Beast does not intend to
    reinvent them or to redundantly provide this information.
]]

[[
    "A built-in HTTP router?"
][
    We presume this means a facility to match expressions against the URI
    in HTTP requests, and dispatch them to calling code. The authors feel
    that this is a responsibility of higher level code. Beast does
    not try to offer a web server. That said, the server-framework
    example has a concept of request routing called a Service. Two
    services are provided, one for serving files and the other for
    handling WebSocket upgrade requests.
]]

[[
    "HTTP Cookies? Forms/File Uploads?"
][
    Cookies, or managing these types of HTTP headers in general, is the
    responsibility of higher levels. Beast just tries to get complete
    messages to and from the calling code. It deals in the HTTP headers just
    enough to process the message body and leaves the rest to callers. However,
    for forms and file uploads the symmetric interface of the message class
    allows HTTP requests to include arbitrary body types including those needed
    to upload a file or fill out a form.
]]

[[
    "...supporting TLS (is this a feature? If not this would be a show-stopper),
    etc."
][
    Beast works with the Stream concept, so it automatically works with the
    `boost::asio::ssl::stream` that you have already set up through Asio.
]]

[[
    "There should also be more examples of how to integrate the http service
    with getting files from the file system, generating responses CGI-style"
][
    The design goal for the library is to not try to invent a web server.
    We feel that there is a strong need for a basic implementation that
    models the HTTP message and provides functions to send and receive them
    over Asio. Such an implementation should serve as a building block upon
    which higher abstractions such as the aforementioned HTTP service or
    cgi-gateway can be built.

    There are several HTTP servers in the example directory which deliver
    files, as well as some tested and compiled code snippets which can be
    used as a starting point for interfacing with other processes.
]]

[[
    "You should send a 100-continue to ask for the rest of the body if required."
][
    Deciding on whether to send the "Expect: 100-continue" header or
    how to handle it on the server side is the caller's responsibility;
    Beast provides the functionality to send or inspect the header before
    sending or reading the body.
]]



[[
    "I would also like to see instances of this library being used
    in production. That would give some evidence that the design
    works in practice."
][
    Beast has already been on public servers receiving traffic and handling
    hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of financial transactions daily.
    The servers run [*rippled], open source software
    ([@https://github.com/ripple/rippled repository])
    implementing the
    [@https://ripple.com/files/ripple_consensus_whitepaper.pdf [*Ripple Consensus Protocol]],
    technology provided by [@http://ripple.com Ripple].

    Furthermore, the repository has grown significantly in popularity in
    2017. There are many users, and some of them participate directly in
    the repository by reporting issues, performing testing, and in some
    cases submitting pull requests with code contributions.

[[
    What about WebSocket message compression?
][
    Beast WebSocket supports the permessage-deflate extension described in
    [@https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-hybi-permessage-compression-00 draft-ietf-hybi-permessage-compression-00].
    The library comes with a header-only, C++11 port of ZLib's "deflate" codec
    used in the implementation of the permessage-deflate extension.
]]
[[
    Where is the WebSocket TLS/SSL interface?
][
    The `websocket::stream` wraps the socket or stream that you provide
    (for example, a `boost::asio::ip::tcp::socket` or a
    `boost::asio::ssl::stream`). You establish your TLS connection using the
    interface on `ssl::stream` like shown in all of the Asio examples, then
    construct your `websocket::stream` around it. It works perfectly fine;
    Beast comes with an `ssl_stream` wrapper in the example directory which
    allows the SSL stream to be moved, overcoming an Asio limitation.

    The WebSocket implementation [*does] provide support for shutting down
    the TLS connection through the use of the ADL compile-time virtual functions
    [link beast.ref.boost__beast__websocket__teardown `teardown`] and
    [link beast.ref.boost__beast__websocket__async_teardown `async_teardown`]. These will
    properly close the connection as per rfc6455 and overloads are available
    for TLS streams. Callers may provide their own overloads of these functions
    for user-defined next layer types.
