## Introduction

Beast is a C++ header-only library serving as a foundation for writing
interoperable networking libraries by providing **low-level HTTP/1,
WebSocket, and networking protocol** vocabulary types and algorithms
using the consistent asynchronous model of Boost.Asio.

This library is designed for:

* **Symmetry:** Algorithms are role-agnostic; build clients, servers, or both.

* **Ease of Use:** Boost.Asio users will immediately understand Beast.

* **Flexibility:** Users make the important decisions such as buffer or
  thread management.

* **Performance:** Build applications handling thousands of connections or more.

* **Basis for Further Abstraction.** Components are well-suited for building upon.

## Description

This software is in its first official release. Interfaces
may change in response to user feedback. For recent changes
see the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

* [Official Site](https://github.com/boostorg/beast)
* [Documentation](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/master/libs/beast/) (master branch)
* [Autobahn|Testsuite WebSocket Results](https://vinniefalco.github.io/boost/beast/reports/autobahn/index.html)

## Requirements

This library is for programmers familiar with Boost.Asio. Users
who wish to use asynchronous interfaces should already know how to
create concurrent network programs using callbacks or coroutines.

* **C++11:** Robust support for most language features.
* **Boost:** Boost.Asio and some other parts of Boost.
* **OpenSSL:** Optional, for using TLS/Secure sockets.

When using Microsoft Visual C++, Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 or later is required.

One of these components is required in order to build the tests and examples:

* Properly configured bjam/b2
* CMake 3.5.1 or later (Windows only)

## Branches

The official repository contains the following branches:

* [**master**](https://github.com/boostorg/beast/tree/master) This
  holds the most recent snapshot with code that is known to be stable.

* [**develop**](https://github.com/boostorg/beast/tree/develop) This
  holds the most recent snapshot. It may contain unstable code.

Each of these branches requires a corresponding Boost branch and
all of its subprojects. For example, if you wish to use the **master**
branch version of Beast, you should clone the Boost superproject,
switch to the **master** branch in the superproject and acquire
all the Boost libraries corresponding to that branch including Beast.

Or, to use the latest shipping version of Beast, simply use it
from the corresponding distribution of Boost.

## Building

Beast is header-only. To use it just add the necessary `#include` line
to your source files, like this:
```C++
#include <boost/beast.hpp>
```

To build your program successfully, you'll need to add the Boost.System
library to link with. If you use coroutines you'll also need to link
with the Boost.Coroutine library. Please visit the Boost documentation
for instructions on how to do this for your particular build system.

To build the documentation, examples, tests, and benchmarks it is
necessary to first obtain the Boost "superproject" along with sources of
all of the Boost libraries, then run the `b2` command to build the Boost
libraries.
Instructions for doing so may be found on
the [Boost Wiki](https://github.com/boostorg/boost/wiki/Getting-Started).
These commands will build the programs and documentation that come
with Beast (omit the cxxflags parameter when building using MSVC):

```
cd boost   # The directory containing the Boost superproject and libraries
b2 libs/beast/test cxxflags="-std=c++11"    # bjam must be in your $PATH
b2 libs/beast/example cxxflags="-std=c++11"
b2 libs/beast/doc
```

On Windows platforms only, CMake may be used to generate a Visual Studio
solution and a set of Visual Studio project files using these commands:

```
cd boost   # The directory containing the Boost superproject and libraries
cd libs/beast
mkdir bin
cd bin
cmake ..                                    # for 32-bit Windows builds, or
cmake -G"Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" ..    # for 64-bit Windows builds (VS2015), or
cmake -G"Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" ..    # for 64-bit Windows builds (VS2017)
```

The files in the repository are laid out thusly:

```
./
    bin/            Create this to hold executables and project files
    bin64/          Create this to hold 64-bit Windows executables and project files
    doc/            Source code and scripts for the documentation
    include/        Where the header files live
    extras/         Additional APIs, may change
    example/        Self contained example programs
    meta/           Metadata for Boost integration
    scripts/        Small scripts used with CI systems
    test/           Unit tests
```

## Usage

These examples are complete, self-contained programs that you can build
and run yourself (they are in the `example` directory).

## Contributing (We Need Your Help!)

If you would like to contribute to Beast and help us maintain high
quality, consider performing code reviews on active pull requests.
Any feedback from users and stakeholders, even simple questions about
how things work or why they were done a certain way, carries value
and can be used to improve the library. Code review provides these
benefits:

* Identify bugs
* Documentation proof-reading
* Adjust interfaces to suit use-cases
* Simplify code

You can look through the Closed pull requests to get an idea of how
reviews are performed. To give a code review just sign in with your
GitHub account and then add comments to any open pull requests below,

asking them in the code review or in issues provides valuable information
that can be used to improve the library - do not hesitate, no question
is insignificant or unimportant!
