    //! Return the number of elements in the structure for which the
    //! `predicate` is satisfied.
    //! @ingroup group-Foldable
    //!
    //! Specifically, returns an object of an unsigned integral type, or
    //! a `Constant` holding such an object, which represents the number
    //! of elements in the structure satisfying the given `predicate`.
    //!
    //!
    //! @param xs
    //! The structure whose elements are counted.
    //!
    //! @param predicate
    //! A function called as `predicate(x)`, where `x` is an element of the
    //! structure, and returning a `Logical` representing whether `x` should
    //! be counted.
    //!
    //!
    //! Example
    //! -------
    //! @include example/count_if.cpp
