    //! `fold` is equivalent to `fold_left`. However, it is not tag-dispatched
    //! on its own because it is just an alias to `fold_left`. Also note that
    //! `fold` can be called with or without an initial state, just like
    //! `fold_left`:
    //!
    //! @code
    //!     fold(xs, state, f) == fold_left(xs, state, f)
    //!     fold(xs, f) == fold_left(xs, f)
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //!
    //! Example
    //! -------
    //! @include example/fold.cpp
    constexpr auto fold = fold_left;
