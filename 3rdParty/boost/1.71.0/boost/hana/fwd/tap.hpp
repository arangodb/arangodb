    //! Tap inside a monadic chain.
    //! @ingroup group-Monad
    //!
    //! Given a function `f`, `tap<M>` returns a new function which performs
    //! `f` on its argument and then returns the argument lifted in the `M`
    //! `Monad`. Combined with the property that `chain(m, lift<M>) == m`,
    //! this provides a way of executing an action inside a monadic chain
    //! without influencing its overall result. This is useful to e.g. insert
    //! debug statements or perform actions that are not tied to the chain but
    //! that need to be executed inside of it.
    //!
    //! @note
    //! Since C++ is not a pure language, it is possible to perform side
    //! effects inside the `f` function. Actually, side effects are the
    //! only reason why one might want to use `tap`. However, one should
    //! not rely on the side effects being done in any specific order.
    //!
    //!
    //! @tparam M
    //! The tag (a `Monad`) of the monads in the tapped monadic chain.
    //!
    //! @param f
    //! A function to be executed inside a monadic chain. It will be called
    //! as `f(x)`, where `x` is a value inside the previous monad in the
    //! chain. The result of `f` is always discarded.
    //!
    //!
    //! Example
    //! -------
    //! @include example/tap.cpp
