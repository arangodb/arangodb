BOOST_HANA_NAMESPACE_BEGIN
    //! Short-circuiting lexicographical comparison of two `Iterable`s with
    //! an optional custom predicate, by default `hana::less`.
    //! @ingroup group-Iterable
    //!
    //! Given two `Iterable`s `xs` and `ys` and a binary predicate `pred`,
    //! `lexicographical_compare` returns whether `xs` is to be considered
    //! less than `ys` in a lexicographical ordering. Specifically, let's
    //! denote the linearizations of `xs` and `ys` by `[x1, x2, ...]` and
    //! `[y1, y2, ...]`, respectively. If the first couple satisfying the
    //! predicate is of the form `xi, yi`, `lexicographical_compare` returns
    //! true. Otherwise, if the first couple to satisfy the predicate is of
    //! the form `yi, xi`, `lexicographical_compare` returns false. If no
    //! such couple can be found, `lexicographical_compare` returns whether
    //! `xs` has fewer elements than `ys`.
    //!
    //! @note
    //! This algorithm will short-circuit as soon as it can determine that one
    //! sequence is lexicographically less than the other. Hence, it can be
    //! used to compare infinite sequences. However, for the procedure to
    //! terminate on infinite sequences, the predicate has to be satisfied
    //! at a finite index.
    //!
    //!
    //! Signature
    //! ---------
    //! Given two `Iterable`s `It1(T)` and `It2(T)` and a predicate
    //! \f$ pred : T \times T \to Bool \f$ (where `Bool` is some `Logical`),
    //! `lexicographical_compare` has the following signatures. For the
    //! variant with a provided predicate,
    //! \f[
    //!     \mathtt{lexicographical\_compare}
    //!         : It1(T) \times It2(T) \times (T \times T \to Bool) \to Bool
    //! \f]
    //!
    //! for the variant without a custom predicate, `T` is required to be
    //! `Orderable`. The signature is then
    //! \f[
    //!     \mathtt{lexicographical\_compare} : It1(T) \times It2(T) \to Bool
    //! \f]
    //!
    //! @param xs, ys
    //! Two `Iterable`s to compare lexicographically.
    //!
    //! @param pred
    //! A binary function called as `pred(x, y)` and `pred(y, x)`, where `x`
    //! and `y` are elements of `xs` and `ys`, respectively. `pred` must
    //! return a `Logical` representing whether its first argument is to be
    //! considered as less than its second argument. Also note that `pred`
    //! must define a total ordering as defined by the `Orderable` concept.
    //! When `pred` is not provided, it defaults to `less`.
    //!
    //!
    //! Example
    //! -------
    //! @include example/lexicographical_compare.cpp
