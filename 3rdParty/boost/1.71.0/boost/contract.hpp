/** @file
Include all header files required by this library at once (for convenience).

All header files <c>boost/contract/\*.hpp</c> are independent from one another
and can be included one-by-one to reduce the amount of code to compile from this
library in user code (but this was measured to not make an appreciable
difference in compile-time so <c>boost/contract.hpp</c> can be included directly
in most cases).
Instead the headers <c>boost/contract/core/\*.hpp</c> are not independent from
other library headers and they are automatically included by the
<c>boost/contract/\*.hpp</c> headers (so the <c>boost/contract/core/\*.hpp</c>
headers are usually not directly included by programmers).

All files under the <c>boost/contract/detail/</c> directory, names within the
@c boost::contract::detail namespace, names prefixed with
@c boost_contract_detail... and @c BOOST_CONTRACT_DETAIL... (in any namesapce,
including user's code) are reserved for internal use of this library and should
never be used directly by programmers.
