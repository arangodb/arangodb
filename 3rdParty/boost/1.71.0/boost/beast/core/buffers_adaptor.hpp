/** Adapts a <em>MutableBufferSequence</em> into a <em>DynamicBuffer</em>.

    This class wraps a <em>MutableBufferSequence</em> to meet the requirements
    of <em>DynamicBuffer</em>. Upon construction the input and output sequences
    are empty. A copy of the mutable buffer sequence object is stored; however,
    ownership of the underlying memory is not transferred. The caller is
    responsible for making sure that referenced memory remains valid
    for the duration of any operations.

    The size of the mutable buffer sequence determines the maximum
    number of bytes which may be prepared and committed.
