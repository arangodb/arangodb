/** A dynamic buffer using a fixed size internal buffer.

    A dynamic buffer encapsulates memory storage that may be
    automatically resized as required, where the memory is
    divided into two regions: readable bytes followed by
    writable bytes. These memory regions are internal to
    the dynamic buffer, but direct access to the elements
    is provided to permit them to be efficiently used with
    I/O operations.

    Objects of this type meet the requirements of <em>DynamicBuffer</em>
    and have the following additional properties:

    @li A mutable buffer sequence representing the readable
    bytes is returned by @ref data when `this` is non-const.

    @li Buffer sequences representing the readable and writable
    bytes, returned by @ref data and @ref prepare, will have
    length one.

    @li Ownership of the underlying storage belongs to the
    derived class.

    @note Variables are usually declared using the template class
    @ref flat_static_buffer; however, to reduce the number of template
    instantiations, objects should be passed `flat_static_buffer_base&`.

    @see flat_static_buffer
