/** Stream wrapper to process Shoutcast HTTP responses

    This wrapper replaces the word "ICY" in the first
    HTTP response received on the connection, with "HTTP/1.1".
    This allows the Beast parser to be used with Shoutcast
    servers, which send a non-standard HTTP message as the
    response.

    For asynchronous operations, the application must ensure
    that they are are all performed within the same implicit
    or explicit strand.

    @par Thread Safety
    @e Distinct @e objects: Safe.@n
    @e Shared @e objects: Unsafe.
    The application must also ensure that all asynchronous
    operations are performed within the same implicit or explicit strand.

    @par Example
    To use the @ref icy_stream template with an @ref tcp_stream
    you would write:
    @code
    http::icy_stream<tcp_stream> is(ioc);
    @endcode

    @tparam NextLayer The type representing the next layer, to which
    data will be read and written during operations. For synchronous
    operations, the type must support the <em>SyncStream</em> concept.
    For asynchronous operations, the type must support the
    <em>AsyncStream</em> concept.

    @note A stream object must not be moved or destroyed while there
    are pending asynchronous operations associated with it.

    @par Concepts
