/** Provides message-oriented functionality using WebSocket.

    The @ref stream class template provides asynchronous and blocking
    message-oriented functionality necessary for clients and servers
    to utilize the WebSocket protocol.

    For asynchronous operations, the application must ensure
    that they are are all performed within the same implicit
    or explicit strand.

    @par Thread Safety
    @e Distinct @e objects: Safe.@n
    @e Shared @e objects: Unsafe.
    The application must also ensure that all asynchronous
    operations are performed within the same implicit or explicit strand.

    @par Example
    To declare the @ref stream object with a @ref tcp_stream in a
    multi-threaded asynchronous program using a strand, you may write:
    @code
    websocket::stream<tcp_stream> ws{net::io_context::strand(ioc)};
    @endcode
    Alternatively, for a single-threaded or synchronous application
    you may write:
    @code
    websocket::stream<tcp_stream> ws(ioc);
    @endcode

    @tparam NextLayer The type representing the next layer, to which
    data will be read and written during operations. For synchronous
    operations, the type must support the <em>SyncStream</em> concept.
    For asynchronous operations, the type must support the
    <em>AsyncStream</em> concept.

    @tparam deflateSupported A `bool` indicating whether or not the
    stream will be capable of negotiating the permessage-deflate websocket
    extension. Note that even if this is set to `true`, the permessage
    deflate options (set by the caller at runtime) must still have the
    feature enabled for a successful negotiation to occur.

    @note A stream object must not be moved or destroyed while there
    are pending asynchronous operations associated with it.

        @li @ref beast::websocket::stream::async_read

        Unlike completion handlers, the callback will be invoked
        for each control frame during a call to any synchronous
        or asynchronous read function. The operation is passive,
        with no associated error code, and triggered by reads.

        For close frames, the close reason code may be obtained by

            string_view payload    // The payload in the frame

        an asynchronous operation, the callback will be invoked using
        the same method as that used to invoke the final handler.

        @note Incoming ping and close frames are automatically
        handled. Pings are responded to with pongs, and a close frame
        is responded to with a close frame leading to the closure of
        the stream. It is not necessary to manually send pings, pongs,
        or close frames from inside the control callback.

        data.

        Lowering the size of the buffer can decrease the memory requirements

    /** Write some message data asynchronously.

        This function is used to asynchronously write part of a message.

        This call always returns immediately. The asynchronous operation
        will continue until one of the following conditions is true:

        @li The message data is written.

        @li An error occurs.

        The algorithm, known as a <em>composed asynchronous operation</em>,
        is implemented in terms of calls to the next layer's
        `async_write_some` function. The program must ensure that no other
        calls to @ref write, @ref write_some, @ref async_write, or
        @ref async_write_some are performed until this operation completes.

        If this is the beginning of a new message, the message opcode
        will be set to text or binary based on the current setting of
        the @ref binary (or @ref text) option. The actual payload sent
        may be transformed as per the WebSocket protocol settings.

        @param fin `true` if this is the last part of the message.

        @param buffers The buffers containing the message part to send.
        The implementation will make copies of this object
        as needed, but ownership of the underlying memory is not
        transferred. The caller is responsible for ensuring that
        the memory locations pointed to by buffers remains valid
        until the completion handler is called.

        @param handler The completion handler to invoke when the operation
        completes. The implementation takes ownership of the handler by
        performing a decay-copy. The equivalent function signature of
        the handler must be:
        @code
        void handler(
            error_code const& ec,           // Result of operation
            std::size_t bytes_transferred   // Number of bytes sent from the
                                            // buffers. If an error occurred,
                                            // this will be less than the buffer_size.
        );
        @endcode
        Regardless of whether the asynchronous operation completes
        immediately or not, the handler will not be invoked from within
        this function. Invocation of the handler will be performed in a
        manner equivalent to using `net::post`.
