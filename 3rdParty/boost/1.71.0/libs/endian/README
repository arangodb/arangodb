Boost Endian library

The Endian library is included in Boost release 1.58.0 and later.

See http://boostorg.github.io/endian to browse the documentation without having to
download the library or install Boost.

To experiment with the Endian library, various other boost libraries must be
available. So you need to install Boost or clone a current version of boostorg/boost
if you have not already done so.

Boost.Endian is a header-only library, so there is no need to run a build
for it, although you may need to do a "b2 headers".

If your clone of boost is already in place, please remember to:

  cd boost
  git pull
  git submodule update --init
  git submodule update
  ./b2 headers
  
On Windows, "./" is unnecessary.
