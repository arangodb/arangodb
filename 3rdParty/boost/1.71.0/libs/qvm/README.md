QVM: Generic C++ library for working with Quaternions, Vectors and Matrices

Official documentation: https://boostorg.github.io/qvm/

* Emphasis on 2, 3 and 4-dimensional operations needed in graphics, video games and simulation applications.
* Free function templates operate on any compatible user-defined quaternion, vector or matrix type.
* Quaternion, vector and matrix types from different libraries or subsystems can be safely mixed in the same expression.
* Type-safe mapping between compatible lvalue types with no temporary objects; e.g. transpose remaps the elements, rather than transforming the matrix.
