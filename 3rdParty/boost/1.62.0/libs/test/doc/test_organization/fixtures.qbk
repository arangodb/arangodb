[section:fixtures Fixtures]
In general terms a test fixture or test context is the collection of one or more of the following items, required
to perform the test:
 
* preconditions
* particular states of tested units
* necessary cleanup procedures

Though these tasks are encountered in many if not all test cases, what makes a test fixture different is
repetition. Where a normal test case implementation does all preparatory and cleanup work itself, a test fixture
allows it to be implemented in a separate reusable unit.

With introduction of e[*X]treme [*P]rogramming (XP), the testing style, that require test setup/cleanup repetition,
has become even more popular. Single XP adopted test modules may contain hundreds of single assertion test cases,
many requiring very similar test setup/cleanup. This is the problem that the test fixture is designed to solve.

In practice a test fixture usually is a combination of `setup` and `teardown` functions, associated with test case.
The former serves the purposes of test setup. The later is dedicated to the cleanup tasks. Ideally we'd like for a 
test module author to be able to define variables used in fixtures on the stack and, at the same time, to refer to 
them directly in a test case.
 
It's important to understand that C++ provides a way to implement a straightforward test fixture solution
that almost satisfies our requirements without any extra support from the test framework. Here is how simple test 
module with such a fixture may look like:

``
struct MyFixture {
  MyFixture()   { i = new int; *i = 0 }
  ~MyFixture()  { delete i; }
 
  int* i;
};

__BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE__( test_case1 )
{
  MyFixture f;
  // do something involving f.i
}

__BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE__( test_case2 )
{
  MyFixture f;
  // do something involving f.i
}
``


This is a generic solution that can be used to implement any kind of shared setup or cleanup procedure. Still
there are several more or less minor practical issues with this pure C++ based fixtures solution:

* We need to add a fixture declaration statement into each test case manually.
* Objects defined in fixture are references with `<fixture-instance-name>` prefix.
* There is no place to execute a ['global] fixture, which performs ['global] setup/cleanup
  procedures before and after testing.

The __UTF__ lets you define a fixture according to [link boost_test.tests_organization.fixtures.models several generic interfaces], 
and thus helps you with following tasks:

* define shared setup/teardown procedures for a single or group of test cases 
* define setup/teardown procedures which are performed once per test suite 
* define global setup/teardown procedures which are performed once per test module

[/ ###################################################################################### ]
[section:models Fixture models]

Several fixture interfaces are supported by the __UTF__. The choice of the interface depends
mainly on the usage of the fixture. 

[h3 Fixture class model]
The __UTF__ defines the generic fixture class model as follows:

``
struct <fixture-name>{
  <fixture-name>();      // setup function
  ~<fixture-name>();     // teardown function
};
``

In other words a fixture is expected to be implemented as a class where the class constructor serves as a `setup`
method and class destructor serves as `teardown` method. The __UTF__ opted to avoid explicit names in fixture
interface for `setup` and `teardown` methods, since it is considered most natural in C++ for tasks similar to RAII and
coincides with the pure C++ solution discussed above.

This model is expected from fixtures used with __BOOST_FIXTURE_TEST_CASE__ and __BOOST_FIXTURE_TEST_SUITE__.

[caution The above interface prevents you from reporting errors in the `teardown` procedure using an exception. It does make
    sense though: if somehow more than one fixture is assigned to a test unit (e.g. using __decorator_fixture__ decorator), 
    you want all `teardown` procedures to run, even if some may experience problems.
]


[h3 Flexible models]
In addition to __BOOST_FIXTURE_TEST_CASE__ and __BOOST_FIXTURE_TEST_SUITE__ the __UTF__ allows to associate fixture with 
test unit using the decorator __decorator_fixture__. This decorator supports additional models for declaring 
the `setup` and `teardown`:

* a fixture defined according to the fixture class model above
* a fixture defined according to the extended fixture class model, which allows for the fixture constructor to 
  takes one argument. For example:

    struct Fx
    {
      std::string s;
      Fx(std::string s = "") : s(s)
            { BOOST_TEST_MESSAGE("set up " << s); }
      ~Fx() { BOOST_TEST_MESSAGE("tear down " << s); }
    };

* a fixture defined as a pair of free functions for the `setup` and `teardown` (latter optional)

    void setup() { BOOST_TEST_MESSAGE("set up"); }
    void teardown() { BOOST_TEST_MESSAGE("tear down"); }

For complete example of test module which uses these models please check decorator __decorator_fixture__.

[/ ###################################################################################### ]
[section:case Test case fixture]
A /test case fixture/ is a fixture consumed by a test case: the fixture `setup` is called before the test case executes,
and the fixture `teardown` is called after the test case finished its execution, independently from its execution state. 

The __UTF__ provides several ways of defining fixtures for test-cases, each of which having their properties:

* the declaration of a fixture for a single test case, letting the test case access the members of the fixture,
* the declaration of one or more fixture(s) for a single test case, without accessing the members and with a flexible interface,
* the declaration of a fixture for a group of test-cases defined by a subtree, with access to the members of the fixture.


[h3 Single test case fixture]
The following two methods are available for declaring a fixture attached to one particular test case:

* the use of the macro __BOOST_FIXTURE_TEST_CASE__ in place of __BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE__, which let access to the members of the fixture
* the use of the decorator __decorator_fixture__, which does not let access to the members but enables 
  the definition of several fixtures for one test case. 

[/ ------------------------------------------------------------------------ ]
[#test_case_fixture_macro][h4 Fixture with `BOOST_FIXTURE_TEST_CASE`]

`BOOST_FIXTURE_TEST_CASE` serves as a test case declaration with a fixture, and is meant be used in place of 
the test case declaration with __BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE__:

``
  BOOST_FIXTURE_TEST_CASE(test_case_name, fixture_name);
``

The only difference from the macro __BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE__ is the presence of an extra argument `fixture_name`. 
The public and protected members of the fixture are directly accessible from the test case body. Only
one fixture can be attached to a test-case [footnote it is still possible to define a class inheriting from several 
fixtures, that will act as a proxy fixture.].

[note You can't access private members of fixture, but then why would you make anything private?]

[bt_example example18..Per test case fixture..run-fail]

In this example only `test_case1` and `test_case2` have fixture `F` assigned. 
You still need to refer to the fixture name in every test case. [link test_case_fixture_subtree This] section 
explains how a same fixture can be declared for a subtree under a test suite.

[/ ------------------------------------------------------------------------ ]
[#test_case_fixture_decorator][h4 Fixture with `fixture` decorator]
By using the decorator __decorator_fixture__, it is possible to:

* attach several fixtures to a unique test case
* use a flexible fixture interface (see [link boost_test.tests_organization.fixtures.models here])

[note Using the decorator approach, it is not possible to access the members of the fixture (in case the fixture is implemented 
 as a class)]



[/ ###################################################################################### ]
[#test_case_fixture_subtree][h3 Fixture for a complete subtree]

If all test cases in a test sub tree require the same fixture (you can group test cases in a test suite based on a
fixture required) you can make another step toward an automation of a test fixture assignment. To assign the
same shared fixture for all test cases in a test suite, use the macro __BOOST_FIXTURE_TEST_SUITE__ in place of the
macro __BOOST_AUTO_TEST_SUITE__ for automated test suite creation and registration.

``
  BOOST_FIXTURE_TEST_SUITE(suite_name, fixture_name);
``

Once again the only difference from the macro __BOOST_AUTO_TEST_SUITE__ usage is the presence of
an extra argument - the fixture name. And now, you not only have direct access to the public and protected members
of the fixture, but also do not need to refer to the fixture name in test case definition. All test cases assigned
the same fixture automatically.

[tip If necessary you can reset the fixture for a particular test case using the macro
    __BOOST_FIXTURE_TEST_CASE__. Similarly you can reset the fixture for a particular sub 
    test suite using __BOOST_FIXTURE_TEST_SUITE__.
]

[note The fixture assignment is ['deep]. In other words unless reset by another
    __BOOST_FIXTURE_TEST_SUITE__ or __BOOST_FIXTURE_TEST_CASE__ definition the
    same fixture is assigned to all test cases of a test suite, including ones that belong to the sub test suites.
]

[bt_example fixture_02..Test suite level fixture..run]

[caution The fixture constructor and destructor is called for each test cases (the state of the 
         fixture is not shared among the test cases).]



[endsect] [/ per test case]

[/ ###################################################################################### ]
[section:per_test_suite_fixture Test suite entry/exit fixture]

It is possible to define a test suite entry/exit fixture, so that the `setup` function is called only once upon entering 
the test suite, prior to running any of its test cases; and similarly the `teardown` function is also called only once 
upon the test suite exit, after all the enclosed test cases have been run. This is facilitated by the 
/decorator/ __decorator_fixture__.

[bt_example fixture_03..Test suite entry/exit fixture..run]

In case of this fixture type, however, it is not possible to access any members of the fixture object.

[caution This is not equivalent to using the method described [link test_case_fixture_subtree here].]

[endsect] [/ per_test_suite_fixture]

[/ ###################################################################################### ]
[section:global Global fixture]

Any global initialization that needs to be performed every time testing begins or a global cleanup that is to be
performed once testing is finished is called a global fixture. The __UTF__ global fixture design is based on the
[link boost_test.tests_organization.fixtures.models generic test class fixture model]. The global
fixture design allows any number of global fixtures to be defined in any test file that constitutes a test module.
Though some initialization can be implemented in the test module initialization function, there are several 
reasons to prefer the global fixture approach:

* There is no place for cleanup/`teardown` operations in the initialization function.
* Unlike the initialization function, the global fixture `setup` method invocation is guarded by the execution
  monitor. That means that all uncaught errors that occur during initialization are properly reported.
* Any number of different global fixtures can be defined, which allows you to split initialization code by
  category.
* The fixture allows you to place matching `setup`/`teardown` code in close vicinity in your test module code.
* If the whole test tree is constructed automatically the initialization function is empty and auto-generated by
  the __UTF__. To introduce the initialization function can be more work than the use of a global fixture facility,
  while global fixture is more to the point.
* Since all fixtures follow the same generic model you can easily switch from local per test case fixtures to
  the global one.
* If you are using the interactive test runner (non-supplied yet) global test fixtures are applied to every run,
  while an initialization function is executed only once during a test module startup (just make sure that
   it's what you really want).

To define a global test module fixture you need to implement a class that matched generic fixture model and
passed it as an argument to the macro __BOOST_GLOBAL_FIXTURE__.

``
  BOOST_GLOBAL_FIXTURE(fixture_name);
``

The statement, that performs global fixture definition, has to reside at a test file scope.
