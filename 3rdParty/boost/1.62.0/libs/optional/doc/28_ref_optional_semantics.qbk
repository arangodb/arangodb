[section Detailed Semantics - Optional Values]

[note
The following section contains various `assert()` which are used only to show
the postconditions as sample code. It is not implied that the type `T` must
support each particular expression but that if the expression is supported,
the implied condition holds.

__SPACE__

[#reference_optional_constructor]

[: `optional<T>::optional() noexcept;`]

* [*Effect:] Default-Constructs an `optional`.
* [*Postconditions:] `*this` is [_uninitialized].
* [*Notes:] T's default constructor [_is not] called.
* [*Example:]
``
optional<T> def ;
assert ( !def ) ;
``

__SPACE__

[#reference_optional_constructor_none_t]

[: `optional<T>::optional( none_t ) noexcept;`]

* [*Effect:] Constructs an `optional` uninitialized.
* [*Postconditions:] `*this` is [_uninitialized].
* [*Notes:] `T`'s default constructor [_is not] called. The expression
`boost::none` denotes an instance of `boost::none_t` that can be used as
the parameter.
* [*Example:]
``
#include <boost/none.hpp>
optional<T> n(none) ;
assert ( !n ) ;
``

* [*Requires:] `is_copy_constructible<T>::value` is `true`.
* [*Effect:] Directly-Constructs an `optional`.
* [*Postconditions:] `*this` is [_initialized] and its value is a ['copy]
of `v`.
* [*Throws:] Whatever `T::T( T const& )` throws.
* [*Notes: ] `T::T( T const& )` is called.
* [*Exception Safety:] Exceptions can only be thrown during
`T::T( T const& );` in that case, this constructor has no effect.
* [*Example:]
``

* [*Postconditions:] `*this` is [_initialized] and its value is move-constructed from `v`.
* [*Throws:] Whatever `T::T( T&& )` throws.
* [*Notes: ] `T::T( T&& )` is called.
* [*Exception Safety:] Exceptions can only be thrown during
`T::T( T&& );` in that case, the state of `v` is determined by exception safety guarantees for `T::T(T&&)`.
* [*Example:]
``
T v1, v2;
optional<T> opt(std::move(v1));
assert ( *opt == v2 ) ;
``


__SPACE__

[#reference_optional_constructor_bool_value]

[: `optional<T>::optional( bool condition, T const& v ) ;` ]

* [*Notes:] If rhs is initialized, `T::T(T const& )` is called.
* [*Exception Safety:] Exceptions can only be thrown during

[: `optional<T>::optional( optional&& rhs ) noexcept(`['see below]`);`]

* [*Requires:] `is_move_constructible<T>::value` is `true`.

* [*Postconditions:] If `rhs` is initialized, `*this` is initialized and
its value is move constructed from `rhs`; else `*this` is uninitialized.
* [*Throws:] Whatever `T::T( T&& )` throws.
* [*Remarks:] The expression inside `noexcept` is equivalent to `is_nothrow_move_constructible<T>::value`.

* [*Exception Safety:] Exceptions can only be thrown during
`T::T( T&& );` in that case, `rhs` remains initialized and the value of `*rhs` is determined by exception safety of `T::T(T&&)`.
* [*Example:]

[: `template<U> explicit optional<T>::optional( optional<U> const& rhs );`]

* [*Effect:] Copy-Constructs an `optional`.
* [*Postconditions:] If `rhs` is initialized, `*this` is initialized and its
value is a ['copy] of the value of rhs converted to type `T`; else `*this` is
uninitialized.
* [*Throws:] Whatever `T::T( U const& )` throws.
* [*Notes: ] `T::T( U const& )` is called if `rhs` is initialized, which requires a
valid conversion from `U` to `T`.
* [*Exception Safety:] Exceptions can only be thrown during `T::T( U const& );`
in that case, this constructor has no effect.
* [*Example:]
``
optional<double> x(123.4);
assert ( *x == 123.4 ) ;

optional<int> y(x) ;
assert( *y == 123 ) ;
``

__SPACE__

[#reference_optional_move_constructor_other_optional]

[: `template<U> explicit optional<T>::optional( optional<U>&& rhs );`]

* [*Effect:] Move-constructs an `optional`.

value is move-constructed from `*rhs`; else `*this` is
uninitialized.
* [*Throws:] Whatever `T::T( U&& )` throws.

[#reference_optional_constructor_factory]

[: `template<InPlaceFactory> explicit optional<T>::optional( InPlaceFactory const& f );`]
[: `template<TypedInPlaceFactory> explicit optional<T>::optional( TypedInPlaceFactory const& f );`]

* [*Effect:] Constructs an `optional` with a value of `T` obtained from the
factory.
* [*Postconditions: ] `*this` is [_initialized] and its value is ['directly given]
from the factory `f` (i.e., the value [_is not copied]).
* [*Throws:] Whatever the `T` constructor called by the factory throws.
* [*Notes:] See [link boost_optional.tutorial.in_place_factories In-Place Factories]
* [*Exception Safety:] Exceptions can only be thrown during the call to
the `T` constructor used by the factory; in that case, this constructor has
no effect.
* [*Example:]
``
class C { C ( char, double, std::string ) ; } ;

C v('A',123.4,"hello");

__SPACE__

[#reference_optional_operator_equal_value]

[: `optional& optional<T>::operator= ( T const& rhs ) ;`]

* [*Effect:] Assigns the value `rhs` to an `optional`.
* [*Postconditions: ] `*this` is initialized and its value is a ['copy] of `rhs`.
* [*Throws:] Whatever `T::operator=( T const& )` or `T::T(T const&)` throws.
* [*Notes:] If `*this` was initialized, `T`'s assignment operator is used,
otherwise, its copy-constructor is used.
* [*Exception Safety:] In the event of an exception, the initialization
state of `*this` is unchanged and its value unspecified as far as `optional`
is concerned (it is up to `T`'s `operator=()`). If `*this` is initially
uninitialized and `T`'s ['copy constructor] fails, `*this` is left properly
uninitialized.
* [*Example:]
``
T x;
optional<T> def ;
optional<T> opt(x) ;

T y;
def = y ;
assert ( *def == y ) ;
opt = y ;
assert ( *opt == y ) ;

* [*Throws:] Whatever `T::operator=( T&& )` or `T::T(T &&)` throws.
* [*Notes:] If `*this` was initialized, `T`'s move-assignment operator is used,
otherwise, its move-constructor is used.

state of `*this` is unchanged and its value unspecified as far as `optional`
is concerned (it is up to `T`'s `operator=()`). If `*this` is initially
uninitialized and `T`'s ['move constructor] fails, `*this` is left properly

thrown during the call to `T`'s move constructor, the state of `*rhs` is determined by the exception safety guarantee
of `T`'s move constructor. If an exception is thrown during the call to T's move-assignment, the state of `**this` and `*rhs` is determined by the exception safety guarantee of T's move assignment.

[#reference_optional_emplace]

[: `template<class... Args> void optional<T>::emplace( Args&&... args );`]

* [*Requires:] The compiler supports rvalue references and variadic templates.

 Then initializes in-place the contained value as if direct-initializing an object
 of type `T` with `std::forward<Args>(args)...`. 
* [*Postconditions: ] `*this` is [_initialized].
* [*Throws:] Whatever the selected `T`'s  constructor throws.
* [*Exception Safety:] If an exception is thrown during the initialization of `T`, `*this` is ['uninitialized].
* [*Notes:] `T` need not be __MOVE_CONSTRUCTIBLE__ or `MoveAssignable`. 
 On compilers that do not support variadic templates, the signature falls back to two overloads:`template<class Arg> void emplace(Arg&& arg)` and `void emplace()`. 
 On compilers that do not support rvalue references, the signature falls back to three overloads: taking `const` and non-`const` lvalue reference, and third with empty function argument list.

[#reference_operator_compare_equal_optional_optional]

[: `bool operator == ( optional<T> const& x, optional<T> const& y );`]

* [*Requires:] `T` shall meet requirements of __SGI_EQUALITY_COMPARABLE__.
* [*Returns:] If both `x` and `y` are initialized, `(*x == *y)`. If only
`x` or `y` is initialized, `false`. If both are uninitialized, `true`.
* [*Notes:] This definition guarantees that `optional<T>` not containing a value is compared unequal to any `optional<T>` containing any value, and equal to any other `optional<T>` not containing a value.
Pointers have shallow relational operators while `optional` has deep relational operators. Do not use `operator==` directly in generic code which expect to be given either an `optional<T>` or a pointer; use
__FUNCTION_EQUAL_POINTEES__ instead
* [*Example:]
``
optional<T> oN, oN_;
optional<T> o1(T(1)), o1_(T(1));
optional<T> o2(T(2));

assert ( oN == oN );  // Identity implies equality

[#reference_operator_compare_less_optional_optional]

[: `bool operator < ( optional<T> const& x, optional<T> const& y );`]

* [*Requires:] Expression `*x < *y` shall be well-formed and its result shall be convertible to `bool`.
* [*Returns:] `(!y) ? false : (!x) ? true : *x < *y`.
* [*Notes:] This definition guarantees that `optional<T>` not containing a value is ordered as less than any `optional<T>` containing any value, and equivalent to any other `optional<T>` not containing a value.
Pointers have shallow relational operators while `optional` has deep relational operators. Do not use `operator<` directly in generic code
which expect to be given either an `optional<T>` or a pointer; use __FUNCTION_LESS_POINTEES__ instead. `T` need not be __SGI_LESS_THAN_COMPARABLE__. Only single `operator<` is required. Other relational operations are defined in terms of this one. If `T`'s `operator<` satisfies the axioms of __SGI_LESS_THAN_COMPARABLE__ (transitivity, antisymmetry and irreflexivity), `optinal<T>` is __SGI_LESS_THAN_COMPARABLE__.
* [*Example:]
``
optional<T> oN, oN_;
optional<T> o0(T(0));
optional<T> o1(T(1));

assert ( !(oN < oN) );  // Identity implies equivalence
assert ( !(o1 < o1) );
