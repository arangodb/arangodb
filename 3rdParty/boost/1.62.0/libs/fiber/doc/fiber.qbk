[heading Tutorial]

Each __fiber__ represents a micro-thread which will be launched and managed
cooperatively by a scheduler. Objects of type __fiber__ are move-only.

        boost::fibers::fiber f1; // not-a-fiber

        void f() {
            boost::fibers::fiber f2( some_fn);

            f1 = std::move( f2); // f2 moved to f1
        }


[heading Launching]

A new fiber is launched by passing an object of a callable type that can be
invoked with no parameters.
If the object must not be copied or moved, then ['std::ref] can be used to
pass in a reference to the function object. In this case, the user must ensure
that the referenced object outlives the newly-created fiber.

        struct callable {
            void operator()();
        };

        boost::fibers::fiber copies_are_safe() {
            callable x;
            return boost::fibers::fiber( x);
        } // x is destroyed, but the newly-created fiber has a copy, so this is OK

        boost::fibers::fiber oops() {
            callable x;
            return boost::fibers::fiber( std::ref( x) );
        } // x is destroyed, but the newly-created fiber still has a reference
          // this leads to undefined behaviour

The spawned __fiber__ does not immediately start running. It is enqueued in
the list of ready-to-run fibers, and will run when the scheduler gets around
to it.


[#exceptions]
[heading Exceptions]

An exception escaping from the function or callable object passed to the __fiber__
constructor calls `std::terminate()`.
If you need to know which exception was thrown, use __future__ or
__packaged_task__.


[heading Detaching]

A __fiber__ can be detached by explicitly invoking the __detach__ member
function. After __detach__ is called on a fiber object, that object represents
__not_a_fiber__. The fiber object may then safely be destroyed.

        boost::fibers::fiber( some_fn).detach();

__boost_fiber__ provides a number of ways to wait for a running fiber to
complete. You can coordinate even with a detached fiber using a [class_link
mutex], or [class_link condition_variable], or any of the other [link
synchronization synchronization objects] provided by the library.

If a detached fiber is still running when the thread[s] main fiber terminates,
the thread will not shut down.

[heading Joining]

In order to wait for a fiber to finish, the __join__ member function of the
__fiber__ object can be used. __join__ will block until the __fiber__ object
has completed.

        void some_fn() {
            ...
        }

        boost::fibers::fiber f( some_fn);
        ...
        f.join();

If the fiber has already completed, then __join__ returns immediately and
the joined __fiber__ object becomes __not_a_fiber__.


[heading Destruction]

When a __fiber__ object representing a valid execution context (the fiber is
__joinable__) is destroyed, the program terminates. If you intend the fiber to
outlive the __fiber__ object that launched it, use the __detach__ method.

        {
            boost::fibers::fiber f( some_fn);
        } // std::terminate() will be called

        {
            boost::fibers::fiber f(some_fn);
            f.detach();
        } // okay, program continues


[#class_fiber_id]
[heading Fiber IDs]

Objects of class __fiber_id__ can be used to identify fibers. Each running
__fiber__ has a unique __fiber_id__ obtainable from the corresponding __fiber__
by calling the __get_id__ member function.
Objects of class __fiber_id__ can be copied, and used as keys in associative
containers: the full range of comparison operators is provided.
They can also be written to an output stream using the stream insertion
operator, though the output format is unspecified.

Each instance of __fiber_id__ either refers to some fiber, or __not_a_fiber__.
Instances that refer to __not_a_fiber__ compare equal to each other, but
not equal to any instances that refer to an actual fiber. The comparison
operators on __fiber_id__ yield a total order for every non-equal __fiber_id__.

[#class_launch]
[heading Enumeration `launch`]

`launch` specifies whether control passes immediately into a
newly-launched fiber.

        enum class launch {
            dispatch,
            post
        };

[heading `dispatch`]
[variablelist
[[Effects:] [A fiber launched with `launch == dispatch` is entered
immediately. In other words, launching a fiber with `dispatch` suspends the
caller (the previously-running fiber) until the fiber scheduler has a chance
to resume it later.]]
]

[heading `post`]
[variablelist
[[Effects:] [A fiber launched with `launch == post` is passed to the
fiber scheduler as ready, but it is not yet entered. The caller (the
previously-running fiber) continues executing. The newly-launched fiber will
be entered when the fiber scheduler has a chance to resume it later.]]
[[Note:] [If `launch` is not explicitly specified, `post` is the default.]]
]

from an explicitly-launched thread[s] thread-function. That is, in many
