[section Getting Started]

[note Given the ubiquity of `boost::lexical_cast` and the familiarity of the programming community with it, here and further in the documentation `boost::lexical_cast` is often mentioned as a reference.]

[import ../example/getting_started.cpp]

[section Basic Deployment]

For die-hard `boost::lexical_cast` users or as a transitional path to `boost::convert`, one of `boost::convert` deployments is not that different from `boost::lexical_cast` and, in fact, the original `boost::lexical_cast` functionality is easily deployed through `boost::convert` interface:

[getting_started_headers1]
[getting_started_using]
[getting_started_default_converter]
[getting_started_example1]

[important As we explore `boost::convert` behavior and interface further, at first they might appear unduly complex, verbose, etc... nothing like `atoi()`... so famous for all the wrong reasons. :-) It is important to remember that a conversion request is only a ['request] which may succeed but may also fail... which might not be as rare or as exceptional as one might hope. `boost::convert` (as well as `boost::lexical_cast`) behavior and interfaces reflect that reality.]

[section Flexibility and Adaptability to Change]

[:[*['"There is nothing more constant than change" Heraclitus]]]

Sooner or later (during initial development or in the maintenance phase) flexibility and adaptability become important. Deployment of ['Boost.Convert] helps to adjust and to change in line with the evolution of the requirements. Say, the program flow would benefit from the non-throwing behavior. Then:

[getting_started_using]
[getting_started_example2]

Or, the component is identified as too slow. Then the performance could be improved with minimal effort by replacing the converter:

[getting_started_headers3]
[getting_started_example3]

If, instead, the requirements change to support more input formats or to require a certain output format, then, again, that could be accommodated with:

[getting_started_headers4]
[getting_started_example4]

[endsect]
[section Basic Conversion-Failure Detection]

[getting_started_using]
[getting_started_example5]

The above calls are expressed in English as

* "['convert a string to int]" for `i1` and `i2` and
* "['convert a string to int and return -1 if the conversion fails]" for `i3`.

The `i1` and `i2` deployments look sufficiently close and behave identically. Namely, if the requested conversion fails, an exception is thrown. The user instructions do not describe what to do if conversion fails. Consequently, `boost::lexical_cast` and `boost::convert` treat conversion-failure as "exceptional" and throw.

The `i3` specification, on the other hand, is explicit about conversion failures, so a supplied fallback value is returned if the requested conversion fails.

That basic error detection and processing might be sufficient for a variety of conversion deployments. For example:

[getting_started_example6]

Or

[getting_started_example9_func]
[getting_started_example9]

Or, if we do not care about logging conversion failures:

[getting_started_example7]

So far the deployment of `boost::convert` seems more flexible, more compact and natural (your mileage may vary) and potentially more efficient compared to `boost::lexical_cast` which achieves somewhat similar results with:

[getting_started_example8]

By design, this is `boost::lexical_cast`'s only behavior -- straightforward and comprehensible, but limited.
It makes quite a few legitimate process\/program flows difficult and awkward to implement.
['Boost.Convert] addresses that with additional functionality, flexibility and convenience.
