[section:strtol_converter ['boost::cnv::strtol] Converter]

The converter started as a deployment example (with the `std::strtol` family of functions as its conversion engine) and a part of the performance-test set. Surprisingly, the converter showed fairly decent all-around performance (see [link boost_convert.performance.converters_compared Converters Compared]) and, consequently, has been rewritten and extended to provide additional conversion support and formatting. At the moment it seems to be a good choice with moderate formatting facilities and adequate performance.

It should be noted though that the converter is nowhere as mature as `boost::cnv::lexical_cast` or `boost::cnv::stream` and, therefore, bugs are to be expected.
