'''<indexterm><primary>intersection</primary></indexterm>'''
Calculate the intersection of two geometries. 

[heading Description]
The free function intersection calculates the spatial set theoretic intersection of two geometries. 

[heading Synopsis]
``template<typename Geometry1, typename Geometry2, typename GeometryOut>
bool intersection(Geometry1 const & geometry1, Geometry2 const & geometry2, GeometryOut & geometry_out)``

[heading Parameters]

[table
[[Type] [Concept] [Name] [Description] ]
[[Geometry1 const &] [Any type fulfilling a Geometry Concept ] [geometry1] [A model of the specified concept ]]
[[Geometry2 const &] [Any type fulfilling a Geometry Concept ] [geometry2] [A model of the specified concept ]]
[[GeometryOut &] [Collection of geometries (e.g. std::vector, std::deque, boost::geometry::multi*) of which the value_type fulfills a Point, LineString or Polygon concept, or it is the output geometry (e.g. for a box) ] [geometry_out] [The output geometry, either a multi_point, multi_polygon, multi_linestring, or a box (for intersection of two boxes)]]
