[/=================]

[*Breaking changes]

* points accessed through a pointer (e.g. in a linestring) should now be specialized without the pointer. In previous versions a type `my_point` used like `linestring<my_point*>` had to be specalized like: `template<> struct tag<my_point*>`. Now the library itself removes the pointer before calling the traits class, so now it should be like: `template<> struct tag<my_point>`

[*Bugfixes]

* intersection was sometimes wrong for integer points, fixed
* documentation, order of parameters in simplify was wrong, fixed

[/=================]

* warnings: there were several unused parameters, for which gcc/clang warned (patched by Christophe)

[*Bugfixes]

* Robustness issue, in some circumstances the union failed to output. Fixed.
* Robustness issue, in some circumstances the calculated intersection point was outside the segment. Fixed.
* Concept issue, cartesian intersect didn't understand segments other than the provided one. Fixed.
* Sometimes self-intersections in linestrings were missed. Fixed.
* The fusion coordinate system was not registered correctly. Fixed.

[*Solved tickets]

* [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5726 5726] Segment intersection algorithm still assumes 'first', 'second' members
* [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5744 5744] Mistake in fusion adapt example
* [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5748 5748] Needed to include <boost/foreach.hpp>
* [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5954 5954] distance_pythagoras skips sqrt() step

[*Improvements on algorithms]

* Checking self-intersections is now not done automatically, this can blast performance.
* Besides that, checking self-intersections is made faster.
* Intersections now avoid outputting duplicate points. So they output the minimal set.

[*Additional algorithms]

* covered_by: within is defined as "within, not on boundary". covered_by is "within or on boundary"

[*Additional functionality]

* within: strategies can now be specified for within<point, box> and within<box, box>
* convert: a much broader range of conversions is supported
* assign: idem, (currently partly) synonym for convert (but reversed arguments)

[*Additional coordinate types]

* Basic (limited) support for Boost.Rational
