[section:context Struct fcontext_t]

Each instance of __fcontext__ represents a context (CPU registers and stack
space). Together with its related functions __jump_fcontext__ and
__make_fcontext__ it provides a execution control transfer mechanism similar
interface like
[@http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man2/getcontext.2.html
ucontext_t].
__fcontext__ and its functions are located in __context_ns__ and the functions
are declared as extern "C". 

[warning If __fcontext__ is used in a multi threaded application, it can migrated
between threads, but must not reference __tls__.]

[important The low level API is the part to port to new platforms.]

[note If __fls__ is used on Windows, the user is responsible for calling 
__fls_alloc__, __fls_free__.]


[heading Executing a context]

A new context supposed to execute a __context_fn__ (returning void and accepting
void * as argument) will be created on top of the stack (at 16 byte boundary)
by function __make_fcontext__.

            // context-function
            void f(intptr);

            // creates a new stack
            std::size_t size = 8192;
            void* sp(std::malloc(size));

            // context fc uses f() as context function
            // fcontext_t is placed on top of context stack
            // a pointer to fcontext_t is returned
            fcontext_t fc(make_fcontext(sp,size,f));

Calling __jump_fcontext__ invokes the __context_fn__ in a newly created context
complete with registers, flags, stack and instruction pointers.  When control
should be returned to the original calling context, call __jump_fcontext__.
The current context information (registers, flags, and stack and instruction
pointers) is saved and the original context information is restored. Calling
__jump_fcontext__ again resumes execution in the second context after saving the
new state of the original context.

        boost::context::fcontext_t fcm,fc1,fc2;

        void f1(void *)
        {
            std::cout<<"f1: entered"<<std::endl;
            std::cout<<"f1: call jump_fcontext( & fc1, fc2, 0)"<< std::endl;
            boost::context::jump_fcontext(&fc1,fc2,0);
            std::cout<<"f1: return"<<std::endl;
            boost::context::jump_fcontext(&fc1,fcm,0);
        }

        void f2(void *)
        {
            std::cout<<"f2: entered"<<std::endl;
            std::cout<<"f2: call jump_fcontext( & fc2, fc1, 0)"<<std::endl;
            boost::context::jump_fcontext(&fc2,fc1,0);
            BOOST_ASSERT(false&&!"f2: never returns");
        }

        std::size_t size(8192);
        void* sp1(std::malloc(size));
        void* sp2(std::malloc(size));

        fc1=boost::context::make_fcontext(sp1,size,f1);
        fc2=boost::context::make_fcontext(sp2,size,f2);

        std::cout<<"main: call jump_fcontext( & fcm, fc1, 0)"<<std::endl;
        boost::context::jump_fcontext(&fcm,fc1,0);

        output:
            main: call jump_fcontext( & fcm, fc1, 0)
            f1: entered
            f1: call jump_fcontext( & fc1, fc2, 0)
            f2: entered
            f2: call jump_fcontext( & fc2, fc1, 0)
            f1: return

First call of __jump_fcontext__ enters the __context_fn__ `f1()` by starting
context fc1 (context fcm saves the registers of `main()`). For jumping between
context's fc1 and fc2 `jump_fcontext()` is called.
Because context fcm is chained to fc1, `main()` is entered (returning from
__jump_fcontext__) after context fc1 becomes complete (return from `f1()`).

[warning Calling __jump_fcontext__ to the same context from inside the same
context results in undefined behaviour.]

[important The size of the stack is required to be larger than the size of fcontext_t.]

[note In contrast to threads, which are preemtive, __fcontext__ switches are
cooperative (programmer controls when switch will happen). The kernel is not
involved in the context switches.]


[heading Transfer of data]

The third argument passed to __jump_fcontext__, in one context, is passed as
the first argument of the __context_fn__ if the context is started for the
first time.
In all following invocations of __jump_fcontext__ the void * passed to
__jump_fcontext__, in one context, is returned by __jump_fcontext__ in the
other context. 

        boost::context::fcontext_t fcm,fc;

        typedef std::pair<int,int> pair_t;

        void f(void * param)
        {
            pair_t* p=(pair_t*)param;
            p=(pair_t*)boost::context::jump_fcontext(&fc,fcm,(void *)(p->first+p->second));
            boost::context::jump_fcontext(&fc,fcm,(void *)(p->first+p->second));
        }

        std::size_t size(8192);
        void* sp(std::malloc(size));

        pair_t p(std::make_pair(2,7));
        fc=boost::context::make_fcontext(sp,size,f);

        int res=(int)boost::context::jump_fcontext(&fcm,fc,(void *)&p);
        std::cout<<p.first<<" + "<<p.second<<" == "<<res<<std::endl;

        p=std::make_pair(5,6);
        res=(int)boost::context::jump_fcontext(&fcm,fc,(void *)&p);
        std::cout<<p.first<<" + "<<p.second<<" == "<<res<<std::endl;

        output:
            2 + 7 == 9
            5 + 6 == 11


[heading Exceptions in __context_fn__]

If the __context_fn__ emits an exception, the behaviour is undefined.

[important __context_fn__ should wrap the code in a try/catch block.]
[important Do not jump from inside a catch block and then re-throw the
exception in another execution context.]


[heading Stack unwinding]

Sometimes it is necessary to unwind the stack of an unfinished context to
destroy local stack variables so they can release allocated resources (RAII
pattern). The user is responsible for this task.

[[Effects:] [Stores the current context data (stack pointer, instruction
pointer, and CPU registers) to `*ofc` and restores the context data from `nfc`,
which implies jumping to execution context `nfc`. The void * argument, `p`,

[variablelist
[[Precondition:] [Stack `sp` and function pointer `fn` are valid (depending on the architecture
`sp` points to the top or bottom of the stack) and `size` > 0.]]
[[Effects:] [Creates an fcontext_t on top of the stack and prepares the stack
to execute the __context_fn__ `fn`.]]
[[Returns:][Returns a fcontext_t which is placed on the stack.]]
