[section:vmd_vc Visual C++ define]

Microsoft's Visual C++ compiler, abbreviated VC++, is a very popular compiler
but does not implement the standard C++ preprocessor correctly in a number of respects.
Because of this the programmer using the VMD needs to occasionally do things
differently when VC++ is being used. These "quirks" of VC++ have been smoothed over
as much as possible in the VMD library, but are mentioned in further topics and
occasionally must be addressed by the programmer using VMD.

The VMD has a macro that indicates when VC++ is the compiler being used. The
macro is an object-like macro called BOOST_VMD_MSVC. It is set to 1 when VC++
is being used and set to 0 when VC++ is not being used. You can use this macro
in your own macro code whenever you include a VMD header file to write code
which may need special processing for VC++ as outlined in this documentation.
Your macro processing may therefore occasional take the form of:

 #include <boost/vmd/some_header.hpp>
 
 #if BOOST_VMD_MSVC
 
 #define SOME_MACRO ... code for VC++
 
 #else
 
 #define SOME_MACRO ... code for all other compilers
 
 #endif
