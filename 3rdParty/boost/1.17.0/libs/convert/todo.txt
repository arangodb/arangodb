boost-no-inspect

* Adding Doxygen comments to describe briefly the files, functions etc (so users can find which include files may be needed?)
* I don't understand the timing figures given in Performance section.   Some items refer to MSVC express 10, other detailed tables in Boost 1.55 to 11? No Clang results?

* You are not using links to take from the text to the appropriate functions etc
in the  reference section.  Users will find this helpful too.

* The reference section could be much improved by adding brief Doxygen comments to
the files, functions etc.
