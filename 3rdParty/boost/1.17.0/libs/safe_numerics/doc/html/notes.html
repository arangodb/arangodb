<p>This library started out as a re-implementation of the facilities
  provided by <a href="http://safeint.codeplex.com" target="_top">David LeBlanc's SafeInt
  Library</a>. I found this library to be well done in every way. My main
  usage was to run unit tests for my embedded systems projects on my PC.
  Still, from my perspective it had a few issues.</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem"><p>It was a lot of code in one header - 6400 lines. Very unwieldy to
      understand, modify and maintain.</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>I couldn't find separate documentation other than that in the
      header file.</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>It didn't use <a href="http://www.boost.org" target="_top">Boost</a>
      conventions for naming.</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>It required porting to different compilers.</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>It had a very long license associated with it.</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>I could find no test suite for the library.</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>Using later versions of C++ and the its standard library, template
  metaprogramming and <a href="http://www.boost.org" target="_top">Boost
  libraries</a> I managed to (re)implement similar functionality in under
  2000 ? lines of code. I promoted this version as a possible submission to
  the Boost. The feedback I received convinced me that no such library would
  be considered acceptable to the large majority of C++ programmers. It seems
  that the desire for maximum performance overrides any requirement that a
  program be known to be free of bugs. By this time I had a better idea of the
  opportunities available with the latest version of C++ (C++14) and resolved
  to address this issue by creating a library which would provide all the
  facilities of safe numerics at minimal runtime cost. The result is what you
  see here. The library now consists of 7000 lines of code, approximately 50
  separate tests and more than 60 pages of documentation and examples.</p>
<p>Since I wrote the above, I've been contacted by David LeBlanc. He's
  been updating his package and informs me that the latest
  version:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem"><p>SafeInt does not require porting for different compilers, is
        fully supported on gcc, clang, and Visual Studio.</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>The license has been changed from MS-PL to MIT license.</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>The library has had a test suite since before it was public, and
        is now located here:</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>SafeInt also has no external dependencies other than standard
        library files, and doesn't need anything else installed to
        work.</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>His current package can now be found at in <a href="https://github.com/dcleblanc/SafeInt" target="_top">github</a>.</p>
