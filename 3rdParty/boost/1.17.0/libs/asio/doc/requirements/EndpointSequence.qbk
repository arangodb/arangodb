[section:EndpointSequence Endpoint sequence requirements]

A type `X` meets the `EndpointSequence` requirements if it satisfies the
requirements of `Destructible` (C++Std [destructible]) and `CopyConstructible`
(C++Std [copyconstructible]), as well as the additional requirements listed
below.

In the table below, `x` denotes a (possibly const) value of type `X`.

[table EndpointSequence requirements
  [[expression] [return type] [assertion/note\npre/post-condition]]
  [
    [`x.begin()`\n
     `x.end()`]
    [A type meeting the requirements for forward iterators
     (C++Std \[forward.iterators\]) whose value type is convertible to
     a type satisfying the [link boost_asio.reference.Endpoint `Endpoint`]
     requirements.]
    [[half_open_range `x.begin()`,`x.end()`] is a valid range.]
