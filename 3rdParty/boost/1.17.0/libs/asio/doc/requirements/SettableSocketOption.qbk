[section:SettableSocketOption Settable socket option requirements]

A type `X` meets the `SettableSocketOption` requirements if it satisfies the
requirements listed below.

In the table below, `a` denotes a (possibly const) value of type `X`, `p`
denotes a (possibly const) value that meets the [link boost_asio.reference.Protocol
`Protocol`] requirements, and `u` denotes an identifier.
