This example provides an interface in front of boost::xpressive.
A regular expression can be specified by a compile-time string
which is parsed (and verified) at compile-time. A boost::xpressive
object is constructed at runtime based on it.
This is just an example, it supports only a subset of the capabilities
of boost::xpressive.
