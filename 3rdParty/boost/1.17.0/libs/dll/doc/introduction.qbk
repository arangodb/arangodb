Adding a specific features to an existing software applications at runtime could be useful in many cases. Such extensions, or plugins, are usually implemented using Dynamic Library Modules (DLL,SO/DSO) loaded at runtime. 

This library was designed to simplify plugin development using C++ in a portable cross-platform manner. 

Library provides a portable across platforms way to:
