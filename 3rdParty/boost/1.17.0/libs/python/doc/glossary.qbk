[variablelist
[[arity [#arity]]
 [The number of argumnts accepted by a function or member function.
  Unless otherwise specified, the hidden `this` argument to member
  functions is not counted when specifying arity.]]
[[ntbs [#ntbs]]
 [Null-Terminated Byte String, or 'C'-string. C++ string literals are *ntbs*\ es.
  An *ntbs* must never be null.]]
[[raise [#raise]]
 [Exceptions in Python are "raised", not "thrown", as they are in C++.
  When this documentation says that some Python exception is "raised" in
  the context of C++ code, it means that the corresponding Python exception
  is set via the [@http://www.python.org/doc/current/api/exceptionHandling.html Python/'C' API],
  and `throw_error_already_set()` is called.]]
[[POD [#pod]]
 [A technical term from the C++ standard. Short for "Plain Ol'Data":
  A POD-struct is an aggregate class that has no non-static data members
  of type pointer to member, non-POD-struct, non-POD-union (or array of such
  types) or reference, and has no user-defined copy assign- ment operator and
  no user-defined destructor. Similarly, a POD-union is an aggregate union that
  has no non-static data members of type pointer to member, non-POD-struct,
  non-POD-union (or array of such types) or reference, and has no
  user-defined copy assignment operator and no user-defined destructor. A
  POD class is a class that is either a POD-struct or a POD-union. An
  aggregate is an array or a class (clause 9) with no user-declared
  constructors (12.1), no private or protected non-static data members
  (clause 11), no base classes (clause 10), and no virtual functions
  (10.3).]]
[[ODR [#odr]]
 [The "One Definition Rule", which says that any entity in a C++ program must have
  the same definition in all translation units (object files) which make up a program.]]
