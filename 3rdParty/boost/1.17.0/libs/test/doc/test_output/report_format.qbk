[section Report formats][#ref_report_formats]

[section:report_human_readable_format Human readable report format]

The human readable report format is designed to produce the most human friendly description of the
results of a test module testing. This is a default format generated by test modules.

Depending on the framework's report level the output looks like this:

[table 
  [ [Level]
    [Output]
  ]
  
  [ [no report]
    [On this level the framework does not produce result report at all. It make sense 
     to use this level for test modules running unattended (as part of some automated regression 
     testing system, for example)
    ]
  ]

  [ [Confirmation]
    [ 
       [variablelist
         [[Passing test] [\*** No errors detected]]
         [[Skipped test] [\*** The test suite <name> was skipped; see standard output for details]]
         [[Aborted test] [\*** The test suite <name> was aborted; see standard output for details]]
         [[Failed test without failed assertions] [\*** Errors were detected in the test suite <name>; see standard output for details]]
         [[Failed test] [\*** N failures are detected in test suite <name>]]
         [[Failed test with some failures expected] [\*** N failures are detected (M failures are expected) in test suite <name>]]
       ] 
    ]
  ]  
  [ [Detailed]
    [On this level we report result for each test units hierarchically (each test unit is reported as part of parent test unit 
     report. Test cases are reported like this:
        [pre
        Test case/suite <name> has passed/was skipped/was aborted/has failed/ with:
            N assertions out of M passed
            N assertions out of M failed
            N warnings out of M failed
            X failures expected
        ]
     Only relevant lines will appear. If test case does not have failing assertions corresponding line in the report is not shown.

     Test suite in addition to above lines also report these:
            [pre
            N test cases out of M passed
            N test cases out of M passed with warnings
            N test cases out of M failed
            N test cases out of M skipped
            N test cases out of M aborted
            ]
    And similarly to above lines only relevant ones will appear in output.
    ]
  ]  
  [ [Short]
    [Short report format is similar to detailed, but only reports information for master test suite]

[section:report_xml_format XML based report output format]

This report format is designed for automated test results processing. The result report output XML schema
depends on the report level.
