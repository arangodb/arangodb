[section:semantic Adding semantic to a test]

It is sometimes useful to add a /semantic description/ to a test unit, which may be consulted by the user during a dry
run. The user may then choose the test he/she wants to run based on this information, instead of basing his/her choice
on the test unit /name/, or instead of looking at the code.

The __UTF__ provides the decorator __decorator_description__ for that purpose.

Decorator `description` attaches an arbitrary string to the test unit. All strings attached to test units can be
displayed when running a test program with parameter [link boost_test.utf_reference.rt_param_reference.list_content `list_content`].
This can be used for conveying information from the person who composes the test tree to the person who will be 
running the test program. Applying more than one decorator `description` to the same test unit means that the two 
(or more) strings will be concatenated.
