[section:test_naming Tests naming]

[h2 Acceptable characters for names]
The __UTF__ is flexible on the naming the test units (test cases/suites) and
it is possible to use a wide variety of characters. However there are scenarios
where the name of a test unit may collide with other features 
of the __UTF__. For instance:

* a character may collide with specific command line filters for selecting a 
  subset of the test tree. Among those characters: `'@'`, `'+'` or `'/'` 
  (see [link boost_test.runtime_config.test_unit_filtering this section] for 
  more details)
* a name containing a character that is reserved for the shell/terminal, such as
  '!', '\*' ..., may prevent the test name to be passed on the command line *as is*.

To prevent any conflicting declaration, the __UTF__ *sanitizes* the name given to
a test unit (case or suite), prior to adding the test to the test tree. Any 
conflicting character is replaced by an underscore `'_'`. 

[note [*Spaces] are not considered as /special chars/ and are preserved, except for the 
 leading and trailing spaces which are removed.]

[note The sanitization of the test unit names has been introduced in [link ref_CHANGE_LOG_3_7 Boost 1.67]. 
 ]

[h2 Constraints on test names]
The __UTF__ considers an error if two sibling test cases have the same name. This consistency check is performed
at runtime and is not sensitive to test filtering.

For test-cases registered automatically, and within the same compilation unit, a compilation error should be raised by 
the compiler in case of name conflict.
For manual registration of test cases and in case of conflicts, the too __BOOST_TEST_CASE_NAME__ may be used.

The data driven tests are automatically created in an isolated test-suite and with a name that is indexed on the
sample.


[note This constraints does not apply to test-suites: Opening/closing a test-suite declaration
 adds the test-cases to an existing or newly created test-suite of that name.]
