[section Overview]

ToolBox provides some helpful extensions for boost::gil that are too small to be an extension by themselves. There are:

* color spaces: cmyka, gray_alpha, hsl, hsv, lab, xyz
* metafunctions: channel_type_to_index, is_bit_aligned, is_similar, is_homogeneous, get_num_bits, channel_type, get_pixel_type, pixel_bit_size
* image types: indexed_image, subchorma_image
* color converters: gray -> rgba
* and so on.

This extension will hopefully be added on by the community.

This extension is header-only. To use the toolbox just include the boost/gil/extension/toolbox.hpp.

[heading Folder Srtucture ]

The toolbox tries to structure the small boost::gil extensions into various folders. There is a folder for color_spaces, metafunctions, image_types, and color converters.
