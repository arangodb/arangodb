.SH DESCRIPTION
.I  Bzcmp
and

are used to invoke the
.I cmp
or the
.I diff
program on bzip2 compressed files.  All options specified are passed
directly to
.I cmp
or
.IR diff "."
If only 1 file is specified, then the files compared are
.I file1
and an uncompressed
.IR file1 ".bz2."
If two files are specified, then they are uncompressed if necessary and fed to
.I cmp
or
.IR diff "."
The exit status from 
.I cmp
or
.I diff
is preserved.
