If compilation produces errors, or a large number of warnings,
please read README.COMPILATION.PROBLEMS -- you might be able to
adjust the flags in this Makefile to improve matters.

Also in README.COMPILATION.PROBLEMS are some hints that may help
if your build produces an executable which is unable to correctly
handle so-called 'large files' -- files of size 2GB or more.
