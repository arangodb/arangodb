.SH NAME
bzmore, bzless \- file perusal filter for crt viewing of bzip2 compressed text
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bzmore
[ name ...  ]
.br
.B bzless
[ name ...  ]
.SH NOTE
In the following description,
.I bzless
and
.I less
can be used interchangeably with
.I bzmore
and
.I more.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I  Bzmore
is a filter which allows examination of compressed or plain text files
one screenful at a time on a soft-copy terminal.
.I bzmore
works on files compressed with
.I bzip2
and also on uncompressed files.
If a file does not exist,
.I bzmore
looks for a file of the same name with the addition of a .bz2 suffix.
.PP
.I Bzmore
normally pauses after each screenful, printing --More--
at the bottom of the screen.
If the user then types a carriage return, one more line is displayed.
If the user hits a space,
another screenful is displayed.  Other possibilities are enumerated later.
.PP
.I Bzmore
looks in the file
.I /etc/termcap
to determine terminal characteristics,
and to determine the default window size.
On a terminal capable of displaying 24 lines,
the default window size is 22 lines.
Other sequences which may be typed when
.I bzmore
pauses, and their effects, are as follows (\fIi\fP is an optional integer
argument, defaulting to 1) :
.PP
.IP \fIi\|\fP<space>
display
.I i
more lines, (or another screenful if no argument is given)
.PP
.IP ^D
display 11 more lines (a ``scroll'').
If
.I i
is given, then the scroll size is set to \fIi\|\fP.
.PP
.IP d
same as ^D (control-D)
.PP
.IP \fIi\|\fPz
same as typing a space except that \fIi\|\fP, if present, becomes the new
window size.  Note that the window size reverts back to the default at the
end of the current file.
.PP
.IP \fIi\|\fPs
skip \fIi\|\fP lines and print a screenful of lines
.PP
.IP \fIi\|\fPf
skip \fIi\fP screenfuls and print a screenful of lines
.PP
.IP "q or Q"
quit reading the current file; go on to the next (if any)
.PP
.IP "e or q"
When the prompt --More--(Next file: 
.IR file )
is printed, this command causes bzmore to exit.
.PP
.IP s
When the prompt --More--(Next file: 
.IR file )
is printed, this command causes bzmore to skip the next file and continue.
.PP 
.IP =
Display the current line number.
.PP
.IP \fIi\|\fP/expr
search for the \fIi\|\fP-th occurrence of the regular expression \fIexpr.\fP
If the pattern is not found,
.I bzmore
goes on to the next file (if any).
Otherwise, a screenful is displayed, starting two lines before the place
where the expression was found.
The user's erase and kill characters may be used to edit the regular
expression.
Erasing back past the first column cancels the search command.
.PP
.IP \fIi\|\fPn
search for the \fIi\|\fP-th occurrence of the last regular expression entered.
.PP
.IP !command
invoke a shell with \fIcommand\|\fP. 
The character `!' in "command" are replaced with the
previous shell command.  The sequence "\\!" is replaced by "!".
.PP
.IP ":q or :Q"
quit reading the current file; go on to the next (if any)
(same as q or Q).
.PP
.IP .
(dot) repeat the previous command.
.PP
The commands take effect immediately, i.e., it is not necessary to
type a carriage return.
Up to the time when the command character itself is given,
the user may hit the line kill character to cancel the numerical
argument being formed.
In addition, the user may hit the erase character to redisplay the
--More-- message.
.PP
At any time when output is being sent to the terminal, the user can
hit the quit key (normally control\-\\).
.I Bzmore
will stop sending output, and will display the usual --More--
prompt.
The user may then enter one of the above commands in the normal manner.
Unfortunately, some output is lost when this is done, due to the
fact that any characters waiting in the terminal's output queue
are flushed when the quit signal occurs.
.PP
The terminal is set to
.I noecho
mode by this program so that the output can be continuous.
What you type will thus not show on your terminal, except for the / and !
commands.
.PP
If the standard output is not a teletype, then
.I bzmore
acts just like
.I bzcat,
except that a header is printed before each file.
