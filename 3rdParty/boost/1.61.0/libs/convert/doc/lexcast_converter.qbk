[section:lexical_cast_converter ['boost::cnv::lexical_cast] Converter]

The purpose of the converter is to

* Make use of the `boost::lexical_cast` functionality and performance that many people have become accustomed to and comfortable with;
* Demonstrate how existing independent conversion\/transformation-related facilities might be incorporated in to the ['Boost.Convert] framework.

The converter can easily replace `boost::lexical_cast`, adding flexibility and convenience:

[lexical_cast_headers1]
[lexical_cast_example1]

See the [classref boost::cnv::lexical_cast `boost::cnv::lexical_cast` implementation] for details.

In order for a user-defined type to be integrated into the `boost::lexical_cast` framework and, consequently, deployed with the `boost::cnv::lexical_cast` converter:

* ['TypeOut] needs to be [@http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concept/CopyConstructible ['Copy Constructible]];
* ['TypeOut] needs to be [@http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concept/DefaultConstructible ['Default Constructible]];
* ['TypeOut] needs to be ['Input Streamable];
* ['TypeIn] needs to be ['Output Streamable].

The first two requirements are imposed by the `boost::lexical_cast` design and implementation and the last two requirements by the underlying `std::stringstream` engine.
