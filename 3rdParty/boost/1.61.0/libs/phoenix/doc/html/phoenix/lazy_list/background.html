        The original code of <a href="http://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~smaragd/fc++/" target="_top">FC++</a>
        was developed by Brian McNamara and Yannis Smaragdakis between 2000 and 2003.
        One of the aims of their work was to implement as mich as possible of the
        Haskell prelude in C++. In the end they achieved a very large part of that
        and went on to implement other similar things not in the Haskell prelude.
        This was made up of a large amount of code written very carefully in a consistent
        style which made it easy to extend it to provide more facilities.
      </p>
<p>
        At the end of that time, two versions of it existed, FC++ 1.5 and <a href="http://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~smaragd/fc++/boostpaper/" target="_top">Boost FC++</a> which
        was proposed for inclusion in Boost and rejected. Both are documented on
        <a href="http://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~smaragd/fc++/" target="_top">FC++</a>.
      </p>
<p>
        After 2003 John Fletcher spent a lot of time developing both these versions
        and adding new features to them. One of the reasons intially was that the
        existing versions could handle only a small number of function arguments.
        He was able to inclrease the limit on the number of arguments and use the
        new version to implement a number of new ideas. No new release has ever been
        made although a draft release 1.5.2 exists. Much of his activity is documented
        by <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FunctoidsInCpp" target="_top">FunctoidsInCpp</a>
        where some discussion took place with other people about this work.
      </p>
<p>
        John discussed with Joel de Guzman how to make <a href="http://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~smaragd/fc++/" target="_top">FC++</a>
        compatible with Phoenix. Joel suggested using Phoenix as a basis for a new
        version of <a href="http://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~smaragd/fc++/" target="_top">FC++</a>.
      </p>
<p>
        In 2014 John became the maintainer of Phoenix and after spending time getting
        to know it he has now started to fulfil his idea of a new version of <a href="http://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~smaragd/fc++/" target="_top">FC++</a>. What is emerging
        is significantly different from <a href="http://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~smaragd/fc++/" target="_top">FC++</a>
        in the detail of the implementation. In some ways it will be more powerful
        as it is well integrated with the facilities of Phoenix. In other ways it
        will lack some features of <a href="http://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~smaragd/fc++/" target="_top">FC++</a>
        as they can now be implemented in other ways.
