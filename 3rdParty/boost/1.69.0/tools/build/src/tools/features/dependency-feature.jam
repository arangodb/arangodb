# The following features are incidental since they have no effect on built
# products. Not making them incidental will result in problems in corner cases,
# e.g.:
#
#    unit-test a : a.cpp : <use>b ;
#    lib b : a.cpp b ;
#
# Here, if <use> is not incidental, we would decide we have two targets for
# a.obj with different properties and complain about it.
#
# Note that making a feature incidental does not mean it is ignored. It may be
# ignored when creating a virtual target, but the rest of build process will use
# them.
