/** Returns `true` if the specified HTTP request is a WebSocket Upgrade.

    This function returns `true` when the passed HTTP Request
    indicates a WebSocket Upgrade. It does not validate the
    contents of the fields: it just trivially accepts requests
    which could only possibly be a valid or invalid WebSocket
    Upgrade message.

    Callers who wish to manually read HTTP requests in their
    server implementation can use this function to determine if
    the request should be routed to an instance of
    @ref websocket::stream.

    @par Example
    @code
    void handle_connection(boost::asio::ip::tcp::socket& sock)
    {
        boost::beast::flat_buffer buffer;
        boost::beast::http::request<boost::beast::http::string_body> req;
        boost::beast::http::read(sock, buffer, req);
        if(boost::beast::websocket::is_upgrade(req))
        {
            boost::beast::websocket::stream<decltype(sock)> ws{std::move(sock)};
            ws.accept(req);
        }
    }
    @endcode

    @param req The HTTP Request object to check.

    @return `true` if the request is a WebSocket Upgrade.
