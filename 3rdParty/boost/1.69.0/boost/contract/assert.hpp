    /**
    Preferred way to assert contract conditions.

    Any exception thrown from within a contract (preconditions, postconditions,
    exception guarantees, old value copies at body, class invariants, etc.) is
    interpreted by this library as a contract failure.
    Therefore, users can program contract assertions manually throwing an
    exception when an asserted condition is checked to be @c false (this
    library will then call the appropriate contract failure handler
    @RefFunc{boost::contract::precondition_failure}, etc.).
    However, it is preferred to use this macro because it expands to
    code that throws @RefClass{boost::contract::assertion_failure} with the
    correct assertion file name (using <c>__FILE__</c>), line number (using
    <c>__LINE__</c>), and asserted condition code so to produce informative
    error messages.
    
    @RefMacro{BOOST_CONTRACT_ASSERT}, @RefMacro{BOOST_CONTRACT_ASSERT_AUDIT},
    and @RefMacro{BOOST_CONTRACT_ASSERT_AXIOM} are the three assertion levels
    predefined by this library.
