# Get Rich Quick! Using Boost.Beast WebSockets and Networking TS

Do you want to make a lot of money? You'll see some examples of free
browser and server based WebSocket programs which have earned their
respective individual authors tens of millions of dollars in no time
at all. Perhaps after seeing this talk in person, you'll write the
next massively successful WebSocket app!

The WebSocket protocol powers the interactive web by enabling two-way
messaging between the browser and the web server. The Boost.Beast
library implements this protocol on top of the industry standard
Boost.Asio library which models the Networking Technical Specification
proposed for the ISO C++ Standard.

This presentation introduces Networking TS concepts and algorithms,
how to read their requirements, and how to use them in your programs.
We will build from scratch a multi-user chat server in C++11 using
Beast, and the corresponding browser-based chat client in HTML and
JavaScript. No prior knowledge or understanding of Beast or Asio is
required, the talk is suited for everyone.
