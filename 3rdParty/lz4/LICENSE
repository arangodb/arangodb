This repository uses 2 different licenses :
- all files in the `lib` directory use a BSD 2-Clause license
- all other files use a GPLv2 license, unless explicitly stated otherwise

Relevant license is reminded at the top of each source file,
and with presence of COPYING or LICENSE file in associated directories.

This model is selected to emphasize that
files in the `lib` directory are designed to be included into 3rd party applications,
while all other files, in `programs`, `tests` or `examples`,
receive more limited attention and support for such scenario.
