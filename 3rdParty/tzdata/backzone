# Zones that go back beyond the scope of the tz database

# This file is in the public domain.

# This file is by no means authoritative; if you think you know
# better, go ahead and edit it (and please send any changes to
# tz@iana.org for general use in the future).  For more, please see
# the file CONTRIBUTING in the tz distribution.


# From Paul Eggert (2014-10-31):

# This file contains data outside the normal scope of the tz database,
# in that its zones do not differ from normal tz zones after 1970.
# Links in this file point to zones in this file, superseding links in
# the file 'backward'.

# Although zones in this file may be of some use for analyzing
# pre-1970 timestamps, they are less reliable, cover only a tiny
# sliver of the pre-1970 era, and cannot feasibly be improved to cover
# most of the era.  Because the zones are out of normal scope for the
# database, less effort is put into maintaining this file.  Many of
# the zones were formerly in other source files, but were removed or
# replaced by links as their data entries were questionable and/or they
# differed from other zones only in pre-1970 timestamps.

# Unless otherwise specified, the source for data through 1990 is:
# Thomas G. Shanks and Rique Pottenger, The International Atlas (6th edition),
# San Diego: ACS Publications, Inc. (2003).
# Unfortunately this book contains many errors and cites no sources.

# This file is not intended to be compiled standalone, as it
# assumes rules from other files.  In the tz distribution, use
# 'make PACKRATDATA=backzone zones' to compile and install this file.


# From Paul Eggert (2020-04-15):
# The following remarks should be incorporated into this table sometime.
# Patches in 'git format-patch' format would be welcome.
#
# From Phake Nick (2020-04-15):
# ... the historical timezone data for those China zones seems to be
# incorrect.  The transition to GMT+8 date given there for these zones
# were 1980 which also contradict the file description that they do
# not disagree with normal zone after 1970.  According to sources that
# have also been cited in the asia file, except Xinjiang and Tibet,
# they should have adopted the Beijing Time from around 1949/1950
# depends on exactly when each of those cities were taken over by the
# communist army.  And they should also follow the DST setting of
# Asia/Shanghai after that point of time.  In addition,
# http://gaz.ncl.edu.tw/detail.jsp?sysid=E1091792 the document from
# Chongqing Nationalist government say in year 1945 all of China
# should adopt summer time due to the war (not sure whether it
# continued after WWII ends)(Probably only enforced in area under
# their rule at the time?)  The Asia/Harbin's 1932 and 1940 entry
# should also be incorrect.  As per sources recorded at
# https://wiki.suikawiki.org/n/%E6%BA%80%E5%B7%9E%E5%9B%BD%E3%81%AE%E6%A8%99%E6%BA%96%E6%99%82
# , in 1932 Harbin should have adopted UTC+8:00 instead of data
# currently listed in the tz database according to official
# announcement from Manchuko.  And they should have adopted GMT+9 in
# 1937 January 1st according to official announcement at the time
# being cited on the webpage.

# Ethiopia
# From Paul Eggert (2014-07-31):
# Like the Swahili of Kenya and Tanzania, many Ethiopians keep a
# 12-hour clock starting at our 06:00, so their "8 o'clock" is our
# 02:00 or 14:00.  Keep this in mind when you ask the time in Amharic.
#
# Shanks & Pottenger write that Ethiopia had six narrowly-spaced time
# zones between 1870 and 1890, that they merged to 38E50 (2:35:20) in
# 1890, and that they switched to 3:00 on 1936-05-05.  Perhaps 38E50
# was for Adis Dera.  Quite likely the Shanks data entries are wrong
# anyway.

# Atikokan, Ontario

# From Paul Eggert (1997-10-17):
# Mark Brader writes that an article in the 1997-10-14 Toronto Star
# says that Atikokan, Ontario currently does not observe DST,
# but will vote on 11-10 whether to use EST/EDT.
# He also writes that the Ontario Time Act (1990, Chapter T.9)
# http://www.gov.on.ca/MBS/english/publications/statregs/conttext.html
# says that Ontario east of 90W uses EST/EDT, and west of 90W uses CST/CDT.
# Officially Atikokan is therefore on CST/CDT, and most likely this report
# concerns a non-official time observed as a matter of local practice.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2000-10-02):
# Matthews and Vincent (1998) write that Atikokan, Pickle Lake, and
# New Osnaburgh observe CST all year, that Big Trout Lake observes
# CST/CDT, and that Upsala and Shebandowan observe EST/EDT, all in
# violation of the official Ontario rules.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2006-07-09):
# Chris Walton (2006-07-06) mentioned an article by Stephanie MacLellan in the
# 2005-07-21 Chronicle-Journal, which said:
#
#	The clocks in Atikokan stay set on standard time year-round.
#	This means they spend about half the time on central time and
#	the other half on eastern time.
#
#	For the most part, the system works, Mayor Dennis Brown said.
#
#	"The majority of businesses in Atikokan deal more with Eastern
#	Canada, but there are some that deal with Western Canada," he
#	said.  "I don't see any changes happening here."
#
# Walton also writes "Supposedly Pickle Lake and Mishkeegogamang

# I chatted with a member of my board who has an outstanding memory
# and a long history in Atikokan (and in the telecom industry) and he
# can say for certain that Atikokan has been practicing the current
# time keeping since 1952, at least.

# From Paul Eggert (2006-07-17):
# Shanks & Pottenger say that Atikokan has agreed with Rainy River
# ever since standard time was introduced, but the information from
# McKinnon sounds more authoritative.  For now, assume that Atikokan
# switched to EST immediately after WWII era daylight saving time
# ended.  This matches the old (less-populous) America/Coral_Harbour
# entry since our cutoff date of 1970, so we can move
# America/Coral_Harbour to the 'backward' file.

# Quebec east of Natashquan

# From Paul Eggert (2021-05-09):
# H. David Matthews and Mary Vincent's map
# "It's about TIME", _Canadian Geographic_ (September-October 1998)
# http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/Magazine/SO98/alacarte.asp
# says that Quebec east of the -63 meridian is supposed to observe
# AST, but residents as far east as Natashquan use EST/EDT, and
# residents east of Natashquan use AST.
# The Quebec department of justice writes in
# "The situation in Minganie and Basse-Côte-Nord"
# https://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/en/department/ministre/functions-and-responsabilities/legal-time-in-quebec/the-situation-in-minganie-and-basse-cote-nord/
# that the coastal strip from just east of Natashquan to Blanc-Sablon
# observes Atlantic standard time all year round.
# This common practice was codified into law as of 2007; see Legal Time Act,
# CQLR c T-5.1 <http://legisquebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/ShowDoc/cs/T-5.1>.
# For lack of better info, guess this practice began around 1970, contra to
# Shanks & Pottenger who have this region observing AST/ADT.

# From Chris Walton (2011-12-01):
# There are two areas within the Canadian province of British Columbia
# that do not currently observe daylight saving:
# a) The Creston Valley (includes the town of Creston and surrounding area)
# b) The eastern half of the Peace River Regional District
# (includes the cities of Dawson Creek and Fort St. John)

# Earlier this year I stumbled across a detailed article about the time
# keeping history of Creston; it was written by Tammy Hardwick who is the
# manager of the Creston & District Museum. The article was written in May 2009.
# http://www.ilovecreston.com/?p=articles&t=spec&ar=260
# According to the article, Creston has not changed its clocks since June 1918.
# i.e. Creston has been stuck on UT-7 for 93 years.
# Dawson Creek, on the other hand, changed its clocks as recently as April 1972.

# Unfortunately the exact date for the time change in June 1918 remains
# unknown and will be difficult to ascertain.  I e-mailed Tammy a few months
# ago to ask if Sunday June 2 was a reasonable guess.  She said it was just
# as plausible as any other date (in June).  She also said that after writing
# the article she had discovered another time change in 1916; this is the
# subject of another article which she wrote in October 2010.
# http://www.creston.museum.bc.ca/index.php?module=comments&uop=view_comment&cm+id=56

# Here is a summary of the three clock change events in Creston's history:
# 1. 1884 or 1885: adoption of Mountain Standard Time (GMT-7)
# Exact date unknown
# 2. Oct 1916: switch to Pacific Standard Time (GMT-8)
# Exact date in October unknown; Sunday October 1 is a reasonable guess.
# 3. June 1918: switch to Pacific Daylight Time (GMT-7)
# Exact date in June unknown; Sunday June 2 is a reasonable guess.
# note 1:
# On Oct 27/1918 when daylight saving ended in the rest of Canada,
# Creston did not change its clocks.
# note 2:
# During WWII when the Federal Government legislated a mandatory clock change,
# Creston did not oblige.
# note 3:
# There is no guarantee that Creston will remain on Mountain Standard Time
# (UTC-7) forever.
# The subject was debated at least once this year by the town Council.
# http://www.bclocalnews.com/kootenay_rockies/crestonvalleyadvance/news/116760809.html

# During a period WWII, summer time (Daylight saying) was mandatory in Canada.
# In Creston, that was handled by shifting the area to PST (-8:00) then applying
# summer time to cause the offset to be -7:00, the same as it had been before
# the change.  It can be argued that the timezone abbreviation during this
# period should be PDT rather than MST, but that doesn't seem important enough
# (to anyone) to further complicate the rules.

# The transition dates (and times) are guesses.

# Curaçao
# Milne gives 4:35:46.9 for Curaçao mean time; round to nearest.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# Shanks & Pottenger say that The Bottom and Philipsburg have been at

# Kralendijk and Rincon used Kralendijk Mean Time (-4:33:08) from
# 1912-02-02 to 1965-01-01.  The former is dubious, since S&P also say
# Saba Island has been like Curaçao.
# This all predates our 1970 cutoff, though.
#
# By July 2007 Curaçao and St Maarten are planned to become
# associated states within the Netherlands, much like Aruba;

# Stewart writes that before 1941 some companies in Bahrain were at +0330 and

# +0330 was used by steamers of the British India Co, by Petroleum Concessions
# and by Cable & Wireless; +0323 was used by the Eastern Bank Ltd, BOAC, and

# adopted DST effective 1941-05-24.  Alban suggested adopting DST, R.B. Coomb
# of C&W countersuggested +0330, and although C.A. Rodstrom of Casoc (formerly

# but Bapco switched to +0323 because of "constant confusion", the consensus

# From Paul Eggert (2014-08-11), after a heads-up from Stephen Colebourne:
# According to a Portuguese decree (1911-05-26)
# https://dre.pt/pdf1sdip/1911/05/12500/23132313.pdf
# Portuguese India switched to UT +05 on 1912-01-01.

# Cambodia

# From an adoptive daughter of the late Cambodian ruler Prince Sihanouk,
# via Alois Treindl (2019-08-08):
#
# King Sihanouk said that, during the Japanese occupation, starting with
# what historians refer to as "le coup de force du 9 mars 1945", Cambodia,
# like the entire French Indochina, used Tokyo time zone. After Japan
# surrendered, 2 September 1945, Cambodia fell under French rule again and
# adopted Hanoi time zone again.
#
# However, on 7 January 1946, Sihanouk and Tioulong managed to obtain a
# status of "internal autonomy" from the government of Charles de Gaulle.
# Although many fields remained under the administration of the French
# (customs, taxes, justice, defence, foreign affairs, etc.), the Cambodian
# administration was responsible for religious matters and traditional
# celebrations, which included our calendar and time.  The time zone was GMT
# + 7 and _no_ DST was applied.
#
# After Sihanouk and Tioulong achieved full independence, on 9 November 1953,
# GMT + 7 was maintained.

# Isle of Man
#
# From Lester Caine (2013-09-04):
# The Isle of Man legislation is now on-line at
# <https://www.legislation.gov.im>, starting with the original Statutory
# Time Act in 1883 and including additional confirmation of some of
# the dates of the 'Summer Time' orders originating at
# Westminster.  There is a little uncertainty as to the starting date
# of the first summer time in 1916 which may have been announced a
# couple of days late.  There is still a substantial number of
# documents to work through, but it is thought that every GB change
# was also implemented on the island.
