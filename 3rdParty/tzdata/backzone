# Zones that go back beyond the scope of the tz database

# This file is in the public domain.

# This file is by no means authoritative; if you think you know
# better, go ahead and edit it (and please send any changes to
# tz@iana.org for general use in the future).  For more, please see
# the file CONTRIBUTING in the tz distribution.


# From Paul Eggert (2014-10-31):

# This file contains data outside the normal scope of the tz database,
# in that its zones do not differ from normal tz zones after 1970.
# Links in this file point to zones in this file, superseding links in
# the file 'backward'.

# Although zones in this file may be of some use for analyzing
# pre-1970 timestamps, they are less reliable, cover only a tiny
# sliver of the pre-1970 era, and cannot feasibly be improved to cover
# most of the era.  Because the zones are out of normal scope for the
# database, less effort is put into maintaining this file.  Many of
# the zones were formerly in other source files, but were removed or
# replaced by links as their data entries were questionable and/or they
# differed from other zones only in pre-1970 timestamps.

# Unless otherwise specified, the source for data through 1990 is:
# Thomas G. Shanks and Rique Pottenger, The International Atlas (6th edition),
# San Diego: ACS Publications, Inc. (2003).
# Unfortunately this book contains many errors and cites no sources.

# This file is not intended to be compiled standalone, as it
# assumes rules from other files.  In the tz distribution, use
# 'make PACKRATDATA=backzone zones' to compile and install this file.


# From Paul Eggert (2020-04-15):
# The following remarks should be incorporated into this table sometime.
# Patches in 'git format-patch' format would be welcome.
#
# From Phake Nick (2020-04-15):
# ... the historical timezone data for those China zones seems to be
# incorrect.  The transition to GMT+8 date given there for these zones
# were 1980 which also contradict the file description that they do
# not disagree with normal zone after 1970.  According to sources that
# have also been cited in the asia file, except Xinjiang and Tibet,
# they should have adopted the Beijing Time from around 1949/1950
# depends on exactly when each of those cities were taken over by the
# communist army.  And they should also follow the DST setting of
# Asia/Shanghai after that point of time.  In addition,
# http://gaz.ncl.edu.tw/detail.jsp?sysid=E1091792 the document from
# Chongqing Nationalist government say in year 1945 all of China
# should adopt summer time due to the war (not sure whether it
# continued after WWII ends)(Probably only enforced in area under
# their rule at the time?)  The Asia/Harbin's 1932 and 1940 entry
# should also be incorrect.  As per sources recorded at
# https://wiki.suikawiki.org/n/%E6%BA%80%E5%B7%9E%E5%9B%BD%E3%81%AE%E6%A8%99%E6%BA%96%E6%99%82
# , in 1932 Harbin should have adopted UTC+8:00 instead of data
# currently listed in the tz database according to official
# announcement from Manchuko.  And they should have adopted GMT+9 in
# 1937 January 1st according to official announcement at the time
# being cited on the webpage.


# Zones are sorted by zone name.  Each zone is preceded by the
# name of the country that the zone is in, along with any other
# commentary and rules associated with the entry.

# As explained in the zic man page, the zone columns are:

# Ethiopia
# From Paul Eggert (2014-07-31):
# Like the Swahili of Kenya and Tanzania, many Ethiopians keep a
# 12-hour clock starting at our 06:00, so their "8 o'clock" is our
# 02:00 or 14:00.  Keep this in mind when you ask the time in Amharic.
#
# Shanks & Pottenger write that Ethiopia had six narrowly-spaced time
# zones between 1870 and 1890, that they merged to 38E50 (2:35:20) in
# 1890, and that they switched to 3:00 on 1936-05-05.  Perhaps 38E50
# was for Adis Dera.  Quite likely the Shanks data entries are wrong
# anyway.

# Bahrain
#
# From Paul Eggert (2020-07-23):
# Most of this data comes from:
# Stewart A. Why Gulf Standard Time is far from standard: the fascinating story
# behind the time zone's invention. The National (Abu Dhabi). 2020-07-22.
# https://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/why-gulf-standard-time-is-far-from-standard-the-fascinating-story-behind-the-time-zone-s-invention-1.1052589
# Stewart writes that before 1941 some companies in Bahrain were at +0330 and
# others at +0323.  Reginald George Alban, a British political agent based in
# Manama, worked to standardize this, and from 1941-07-20 Bahrain was at
# +0330.  However, BOAC asked that clocks be moved to gain more light at day's
# end, so Bahrain switched to +04 on 1944-01-01.
#
# Re the 1941 transition, Stewart privately sent me this citation:
# "File 16/53 Enquiries Re: Calculation of Local Time", British Library: India
# Office Records and Private Papers, IOR/R/15/2/1564, in Qatar Digital Library
# https://www.qdl.qa/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00012b
# It says there was no real standard in Bahrain before 1941-07-20.
# +0330 was used by steamers of the British India Co, by Petroleum Concessions
# and by Cable & Wireless; +0323 was used by the Eastern Bank Ltd, BOAC, and
# Bahrein Petroleum (Bapco), and California Arabian Standard Oil Co (Casoc)
# adopted DST effective 1941-05-24.  Alban suggested adopting DST, R.B. Coomb
# of C&W countersuggested +0330, and although C.A. Rodstrom of Casoc (formerly
# of Bapco) stated that Bahrain had formerly used +0330 before Bapco arrived
# but Bapco switched to +0323 because of "constant confusion", the consensus
# was +0330.  The government adopted +0330 in 1941-07-20 and companies seem to
# have switched by 08-01.  No time of day was given for the 1940s transitions.

# The 1876 Report of the Secretary of the [US] Navy, p 305 says that Madras
# civil time was 5:20:57.3.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2014-08-21):
# In tomorrow's The Hindu, Nitya Menon reports that India had two civil time
# zones starting in 1884, one in Bombay and one in Calcutta, and that railways
# used a third time zone based on Madras time (80° 18' 30" E).  Also,
# in 1881 Bombay briefly switched to Madras time, but switched back.  See:

# Cambodia

# From an adoptive daughter of the late Cambodian ruler Prince Sihanouk,
# via Alois Treindl (2019-08-08):
#
# King Sihanouk said that, during the Japanese occupation, starting with
# what historians refer to as "le coup de force du 9 mars 1945", Cambodia,
# like the entire French Indochina, used Tokyo time zone. After Japan
# surrendered, 2 September 1945, Cambodia fell under French rule again and
# adopted Hanoi time zone again.
#
# However, on 7 January 1946, Sihanouk and Tioulong managed to obtain a
# status of "internal autonomy" from the government of Charles de Gaulle.
# Although many fields remained under the administration of the French
# (customs, taxes, justice, defence, foreign affairs, etc.), the Cambodian
# administration was responsible for religious matters and traditional
# celebrations, which included our calendar and time.  The time zone was GMT
# + 7 and _no_ DST was applied.
#
# After Sihanouk and Tioulong achieved full independence, on 9 November 1953,
# GMT + 7 was maintained.

# Isle of Man
#
# From Lester Caine (2013-09-04):
# The Isle of Man legislation is now on-line at
# <https://www.legislation.gov.im>, starting with the original Statutory
# Time Act in 1883 and including additional confirmation of some of
# the dates of the 'Summer Time' orders originating at
# Westminster.  There is a little uncertainty as to the starting date
# of the first summer time in 1916 which may have been announced a
# couple of days late.  There is still a substantial number of
# documents to work through, but it is thought that every GB change
# was also implemented on the island.
