# Zones that go back beyond the scope of the tz database

# This file is in the public domain.

# This file is by no means authoritative; if you think you know
# better, go ahead and edit it (and please send any changes to
# tz@iana.org for general use in the future).  For more, please see
# the file CONTRIBUTING in the tz distribution.

# From Paul Eggert (2014-10-31):

# This file contains data outside the normal scope of the tz database,
# in that its zones do not differ from normal tz zones after 1970.
# Links in this file point to zones in this file, superseding links in
# the file 'backward'.

# Although zones in this file may be of some use for analyzing
# pre-1970 timestamps, they are less reliable, cover only a tiny
# sliver of the pre-1970 era, and cannot feasibly be improved to cover
# most of the era.  Because the zones are out of normal scope for the
# database, less effort is put into maintaining this file.  Many of
# the zones were formerly in other source files, but were removed or
# replaced by links as their data entries were questionable and/or they
# differed from other zones only in pre-1970 timestamps.

# Unless otherwise specified, the source for data through 1990 is:
# Thomas G. Shanks and Rique Pottenger, The International Atlas (6th edition),
# San Diego: ACS Publications, Inc. (2003).
# Unfortunately this book contains many errors and cites no sources.

# This file is not intended to be compiled standalone, as it
# assumes rules from other files.  In the tz distribution, use
# 'make PACKRATDATA=backzone zones' to compile and install this file.


# From Paul Eggert (2020-04-15):
# The following remarks should be incorporated into this table sometime.
# Patches in 'git format-patch' format would be welcome.
#
# From Phake Nick (2020-04-15):
# ... the historical timezone data for those China zones seems to be
# incorrect.  The transition to GMT+8 date given there for these zones
# were 1980 which also contradict the file description that they do
# not disagree with normal zone after 1970.  According to sources that
# have also been cited in the asia file, except Xinjiang and Tibet,
# they should have adopted the Beijing Time from around 1949/1950
# depends on exactly when each of those cities were taken over by the
# communist army.  And they should also follow the DST setting of
# Asia/Shanghai after that point of time.  In addition,
# http://gaz.ncl.edu.tw/detail.jsp?sysid=E1091792 the document from
# Chongqing Nationalist government say in year 1945 all of China
# should adopt summer time due to the war (not sure whether it
# continued after WWII ends)(Probably only enforced in area under
# their rule at the time?)  The Asia/Harbin's 1932 and 1940 entry
# should also be incorrect.  As per sources recorded at
# https://wiki.suikawiki.org/n/%E6%BA%80%E5%B7%9E%E5%9B%BD%E3%81%AE%E6%A8%99%E6%BA%96%E6%99%82
# , in 1932 Harbin should have adopted UTC+8:00 instead of data
# currently listed in the tz database according to official
# announcement from Manchuko.  And they should have adopted GMT+9 in
# 1937 January 1st according to official announcement at the time
# being cited on the webpage.


# Zones are sorted by zone name.  Each zone is preceded by the
# name of the country that the zone is in, along with any other
# commentary and rules associated with the entry.
# If the zone overrides links in the main data, it
# is followed by the corresponding Link lines.
# If the zone overrides main-data links only when building with
# PACKRATLIST=zone.tab, it is followed by a commented-out Link line
# that starts with "#PACKRATLIST zone.tab".

# Ethiopia
# From Paul Eggert (2014-07-31):
# Like the Swahili of Kenya and Tanzania, many Ethiopians keep a
# 12-hour clock starting at our 06:00, so their "8 o'clock" is our
# 02:00 or 14:00.  Keep this in mind when you ask the time in Amharic.
#
# Shanks & Pottenger write that Ethiopia had six narrowly spaced time
# zones between 1870 and 1890, that they merged to 38E50 (2:35:20) in
# 1890, and that they switched to 3:00 on 1936-05-05.  Perhaps 38E50
# was for Adis Dera.  Quite likely the Shanks data entries are wrong
# anyway.

# Atikokan, Ontario

# From Paul Eggert (1997-10-17):
# Mark Brader writes that an article in the 1997-10-14 Toronto Star
# says that Atikokan, Ontario currently does not observe DST,
# but will vote on 11-10 whether to use EST/EDT.
# He also writes that the Ontario Time Act (1990, Chapter T.9)
# http://www.gov.on.ca/MBS/english/publications/statregs/conttext.html
# says that Ontario east of 90W uses EST/EDT, and west of 90W uses CST/CDT.
# Officially Atikokan is therefore on CST/CDT, and most likely this report
# concerns a non-official time observed as a matter of local practice.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2000-10-02):
# Matthews and Vincent (1998) write that Atikokan, Pickle Lake, and
# New Osnaburgh observe CST all year, that Big Trout Lake observes
# CST/CDT, and that Upsala and Shebandowan observe EST/EDT, all in
# violation of the official Ontario rules.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2006-07-09):
# Chris Walton (2006-07-06) mentioned an article by Stephanie MacLellan in the
# 2005-07-21 Chronicle-Journal, which said:
#
#	The clocks in Atikokan stay set on standard time year-round.
#	This means they spend about half the time on central time and
#	the other half on eastern time.
#
#	For the most part, the system works, Mayor Dennis Brown said.
#
#	"The majority of businesses in Atikokan deal more with Eastern
#	Canada, but there are some that deal with Western Canada," he

# Walton also writes "Supposedly Pickle Lake and Mishkeegogamang
# [New Osnaburgh] follow the same practice."

# From Garry McKinnon (2006-07-14) via Chris Walton:
# I chatted with a member of my board who has an outstanding memory
# and a long history in Atikokan (and in the telecom industry) and he
# can say for certain that Atikokan has been practicing the current
# time keeping since 1952, at least.

# From Paul Eggert (2006-07-17):
# Shanks & Pottenger say that Atikokan has agreed with Rainy River
# ever since standard time was introduced, but the information from
# McKinnon sounds more authoritative.  For now, assume that Atikokan
# switched to EST immediately after WWII era daylight saving time
# ended.  This matches the old (less populous) America/Coral_Harbour
# entry since our cutoff date of 1970, so we can move
# America/Coral_Harbour to the 'backward' file.

# From Paul Eggert (2021-05-09):
# H. David Matthews and Mary Vincent's map
# "It's about TIME", _Canadian Geographic_ (September-October 1998)
# http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/Magazine/SO98/alacarte.asp
# says that Quebec east of the -63 meridian is supposed to observe
# AST, but residents as far east as Natashquan use EST/EDT, and
# residents east of Natashquan use AST.
# The Quebec department of justice writes in
# "The situation in Minganie and Basse-Côte-Nord"
# https://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/en/department/ministre/functions-and-responsabilities/legal-time-in-quebec/the-situation-in-minganie-and-basse-cote-nord/
# that the coastal strip from just east of Natashquan to Blanc-Sablon
# observes Atlantic standard time all year round.
# This common practice was codified into law as of 2007; see Legal Time Act,
# CQLR c T-5.1 <http://legisquebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/ShowDoc/cs/T-5.1>.
# For lack of better info, guess this practice began around 1970, contra to
# Shanks & Pottenger who have this region observing AST/ADT.

# From Chris Walton (2011-12-01):
# There are two areas within the Canadian province of British Columbia
# that do not currently observe daylight saving:
# a) The Creston Valley (includes the town of Creston and surrounding area)
# b) The eastern half of the Peace River Regional District
# (includes the cities of Dawson Creek and Fort St. John)

# Earlier this year I stumbled across a detailed article about the time
# keeping history of Creston; it was written by Tammy Hardwick who is the
# manager of the Creston & District Museum. The article was written in May 2009.
# http://www.ilovecreston.com/?p=articles&t=spec&ar=260
# According to the article, Creston has not changed its clocks since June 1918.
# i.e. Creston has been stuck on UT-7 for 93 years.
# Dawson Creek, on the other hand, changed its clocks as recently as April 1972.

# Unfortunately the exact date for the time change in June 1918 remains
# unknown and will be difficult to ascertain.  I e-mailed Tammy a few months
# ago to ask if Sunday June 2 was a reasonable guess.  She said it was just
# as plausible as any other date (in June).  She also said that after writing
# the article she had discovered another time change in 1916; this is the
# subject of another article which she wrote in October 2010.
# http://www.creston.museum.bc.ca/index.php?module=comments&uop=view_comment&cm+id=56

# Here is a summary of the three clock change events in Creston's history:
# 1. 1884 or 1885: adoption of Mountain Standard Time (GMT-7)
# Exact date unknown
# 2. Oct 1916: switch to Pacific Standard Time (GMT-8)
# Exact date in October unknown; Sunday October 1 is a reasonable guess.
# 3. June 1918: switch to Pacific Daylight Time (GMT-7)
# Exact date in June unknown; Sunday June 2 is a reasonable guess.
# note 1:
# On Oct 27/1918 when daylight saving ended in the rest of Canada,
# Creston did not change its clocks.
# note 2:
# During WWII when the Federal Government legislated a mandatory clock change,
# Creston did not oblige.
# note 3:
# There is no guarantee that Creston will remain on Mountain Standard Time
# (UTC-7) forever.
# The subject was debated at least once this year by the town Council.
# http://www.bclocalnews.com/kootenay_rockies/crestonvalleyadvance/news/116760809.html

# During a period WWII, summer time (Daylight saying) was mandatory in Canada.
# In Creston, that was handled by shifting the area to PST (-8:00) then applying
# summer time to cause the offset to be -7:00, the same as it had been before
# the change.  It can be argued that the timezone abbreviation during this
# period should be PDT rather than MST, but that doesn't seem important enough
# (to anyone) to further complicate the rules.

# The transition dates (and times) are guesses.

# Milne gives 4:35:46.9 for Curaçao mean time; round to nearest.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# Shanks & Pottenger say that The Bottom and Philipsburg have been at

# Kralendijk and Rincon used Kralendijk Mean Time (-4:33:08) from
# 1912-02-02 to 1965-01-01.  The former is dubious, since S&P also say
# Saba Island has been like Curaçao.
# This all predates our 1970 cutoff, though.
#
# By July 2007 Curaçao and St Maarten are planned to become
# associated states within the Netherlands, much like Aruba;
# Bonaire, Saba and St Eustatius would become directly part of the

# From Rives McDow (1999-11-08):
# On October 31, when the rest of Nunavut went to Central time,
# Pangnirtung wobbled.  Here is the result of their wobble:
#
# The following businesses and organizations in Pangnirtung use Central Time:
#
#	First Air, Power Corp, Nunavut Construction, Health Center, RCMP,
#	Eastern Arctic National Parks, A & D Specialist
#
# The following businesses and organizations in Pangnirtung use Eastern Time:
#
#	Hamlet office, All other businesses, Both schools, Airport operator
#
# This has made for an interesting situation there, which warranted the news.
# No one there that I spoke with seems concerned, or has plans to
# change the local methods of keeping time, as it evidently does not
# really interfere with any activities or make things difficult locally.
# They plan to celebrate New Year's turn-over twice, one hour apart,
# so it appears that the situation will last at least that long.
# The Nunavut Intergovernmental Affairs hopes that they will "come to
# their senses", but the locals evidently don't see any problem with
# the current state of affairs.

# From Michaela Rodrigue, writing in the
# Nunatsiaq News (1999-11-19):
# http://www.nunatsiaqonline.ca/archives/nunavut991130/nvt91119_17.html
# Clyde River, Pangnirtung and Sanikiluaq now operate with two time zones,
# central - or Nunavut time - for government offices, and eastern time
# for municipal offices and schools....  Igloolik [was similar but then]
# made the switch to central time on Saturday, Nov. 6.

# From Chris Walton (2022-11-06):
# The implication is that Pangnirtung and Qikiqtarjuaq have observed Eastern
# Time as far back as 1984 (and likely even further back than that).
# It is possible that these communities never actually observed Atlantic
# Time, but that would be difficult to prove.
# From Paul Eggert (2022-11-06):

# from America/Iqaluit since 1970.  A Google Books snippet view of

#
# From David Bryan via Tory Tronrud, Director/Curator,

# There is some suggestion, however, that, by-law or not, daylight

# before 1909.... [I]n 1910, the line between the Eastern and Central
# Time Zones was permanently moved about two hundred miles west to

# Syowa, Antarctica
#
# From Hideyuki Suzuki (1999-02-06):
# In all Japanese stations, +0300 is used as the standard time.

# Syowa station, which is the first antarctic station of Japan,
# was established on 1957-01-29.  Since Syowa station is still the main
# station of Japan, it's appropriate for the principal location.

# Vostok, Antarctica

# http://quest.arc.nasa.gov/antarctica/QA/computers/Directions,Time,ZIP
# Vostok, which is one of the Russian stations, is set on the same
# time as Moscow, Russia.
#
# From Lee Hotz (2001-03-08):
# I queried the folks at Columbia who spent the summer at Vostok and this is
# what they had to say about time there:
# "in the US Camp (East Camp) we have been on New Zealand (McMurdo)
# time, which is 12 hours ahead of GMT. The Russian Station Vostok was
# 6 hours behind that (although only 2 miles away, i.e. 6 hours ahead
# of GMT). This is a time zone I think two hours east of Moscow. The
# natural time zone is in between the two: 8 hours ahead of GMT."
#
# From Paul Eggert (2001-05-04):
# This seems to be hopelessly confusing, so I asked Lee Hotz about it
# in person.  He said that some Antarctic locations set their local
# time so that noon is the warmest part of the day, and that this
# changes during the year and does not necessarily correspond to mean
# solar noon.  So the Vostok time might have been whatever the clocks
# happened to be during their visit.  So we still don't really know what time
# it is at Vostok.  But we'll guess +06.

# behind the time zone's invention. The National (Abu Dhabi). 2020-07-22.
# https://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/why-gulf-standard-time-is-far-from-standard-the-fascinating-story-behind-the-time-zone-s-invention-1.1052589
# Stewart writes that before 1941 some companies in Bahrain were at +0330 and
# others at +0323.  Reginald George Alban, a British political agent based in
# Manama, worked to standardize this, and from 1941-07-20 Bahrain was at
# +0330.  However, BOAC asked that clocks be moved to gain more light at day's
# end, so Bahrain switched to +04 on 1944-01-01.
#
# Re the 1941 transition, Stewart privately sent me this citation:
# "File 16/53 Enquiries Re: Calculation of Local Time", British Library: India
# Office Records and Private Papers, IOR/R/15/2/1564, in Qatar Digital Library
# https://www.qdl.qa/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00012b
# It says there was no real standard in Bahrain before 1941-07-20.
# +0330 was used by steamers of the British India Co, by Petroleum Concessions
# and by Cable & Wireless; +0323 was used by the Eastern Bank Ltd, BOAC, and
# Bahrein Petroleum (Bapco), and California Arabian Standard Oil Co (Casoc)
# adopted DST effective 1941-05-24.  Alban suggested adopting DST, R.B. Coomb
# of C&W countersuggested +0330, and although C.A. Rodstrom of Casoc (formerly
# of Bapco) stated that Bahrain had formerly used +0330 before Bapco arrived
# but Bapco switched to +0323 because of "constant confusion", the consensus
# was +0330.  The government adopted +0330 in 1941-07-20 and companies seem to
# have switched by 08-01.  No time of day was given for the 1940s transitions.

# Cambodia

# From an adoptive daughter of the late Cambodian ruler Prince Sihanouk,
# via Alois Treindl (2019-08-08):
#
# King Sihanouk said that, during the Japanese occupation, starting with
# what historians refer to as "le coup de force du 9 mars 1945", Cambodia,
# like the entire French Indochina, used Tokyo time zone. After Japan
# surrendered, 2 September 1945, Cambodia fell under French rule again and
# adopted Hanoi time zone again.
#
# However, on 7 January 1946, Sihanouk and Tioulong managed to obtain a
# status of "internal autonomy" from the government of Charles de Gaulle.
# Although many fields remained under the administration of the French
# (customs, taxes, justice, defence, foreign affairs, etc.), the Cambodian
# administration was responsible for religious matters and traditional
# celebrations, which included our calendar and time.  The time zone was GMT
# + 7 and _no_ DST was applied.
#
# After Sihanouk and Tioulong achieved full independence, on 9 November 1953,
# GMT + 7 was maintained.

#
# From Adam David (1993-11-06):
# The name of the timezone in Iceland for system / mail / news purposes is GMT.
#
# (1993-12-05):
# This material is paraphrased from the 1988 edition of the University of
# Iceland Almanak.
#
# From January 1st, 1908 the whole of Iceland was standardised at 1 hour
# behind GMT. Previously, local mean solar time was used in different parts
# of Iceland, the almanak had been based on Reykjavík mean solar time which
# was 1 hour and 28 minutes behind GMT.
#
# "first day of winter" referred to [below] means the first day of the 26 weeks
# of winter, according to the old icelandic calendar that dates back to the
# time the norsemen first settled Iceland.  The first day of winter is always
# Saturday, but is not dependent on the Julian or Gregorian calendars.
#
# (1993-12-10):
# I have a reference from the Oxford Icelandic-English dictionary for the
# beginning of winter, which ties it to the ecclesiastical calendar (and thus
# to the julian/gregorian calendar) over the period in question.
#	the winter begins on the Saturday next before St. Luke's day
#	(old style), or on St. Luke's day, if a Saturday.
# St. Luke's day ought to be traceable from ecclesiastical sources. "old style"
# might be a reference to the Julian calendar as opposed to Gregorian, or it
# might mean something else (???).

# Netherlands

# Howse writes that the Netherlands' railways used GMT between 1892 and 1940,
# but for other purposes the Netherlands used Amsterdam mean time.

# However, Robert H. van Gent writes (2001-04-01):
# Howse's statement is only correct up to 1909. From 1909-05-01 (00:00:00
# Amsterdam mean time) onwards, the whole of the Netherlands (including
# the Dutch railways) was required by law to observe Amsterdam mean time
# (19 minutes 32.13 seconds ahead of GMT). This had already been the
# common practice (except for the railways) for many decades but it was
# not until 1909 when the Dutch government finally defined this by law.
# On 1937-07-01 this was changed to 20 minutes (exactly) ahead of GMT and
# was generally known as Dutch Time ("Nederlandse Tijd").
#
# (2001-04-08):
# 1892-05-01 was the date when the Dutch railways were by law required to
# observe GMT while the remainder of the Netherlands adhered to the common
# practice of following Amsterdam mean time.
#
# (2001-04-09):
# In 1835 the authorities of the province of North Holland requested the
# municipal authorities of the towns and cities in the province to observe
# Amsterdam mean time but I do not know in how many cases this request was
# actually followed.
#
# From 1852 onwards the Dutch telegraph offices were by law required to
# observe Amsterdam mean time. As the time signals from the observatory of
# Leiden were also distributed by the telegraph system, I assume that most
# places linked up with the telegraph (and railway) system automatically
# adopted Amsterdam mean time.
#
# Although the early Dutch railway companies initially observed a variety
# of times, most of them had adopted Amsterdam mean time by 1858 but it
# was not until 1866 when they were all required by law to observe
# Amsterdam mean time.

# The data entries before 1945 are taken from
# https://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~gent0113/wettijd/wettijd.htm

# Denmark

# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2005-04-26):
# the law [introducing standard time] was in effect from 1894-01-01....
# The page https://www.retsinformation.dk/eli/lta/1893/83
# confirms this, and states that the law was put forth 1893-03-29.
#
# The EU [actually, EEC and Euratom] treaty with effect from 1973:
# https://www.retsinformation.dk/eli/lta/1972/21100
#
# This provoked a new law from 1974 to make possible summer time changes
# in subsequent decrees with the law
# https://www.retsinformation.dk/eli/lta/1974/223
#
# It seems however that no decree was set forward until 1980.  I have
# not found any decree, but in another related law, the effecting DST
# changes are stated explicitly to be from 1980-04-06 at 02:00 to
# 1980-09-28 at 02:00.  If this is true, this differs slightly from
# the EU rule in that DST runs to 02:00, not 03:00.  We don't know
# when Denmark began using the EU rule correctly, but we have only
# confirmation of the 1980-time, so I presume it was correct in 1981:
# The law is about the management of the extra hour, concerning
# working hours reported and effect on obligatory-rest rules (which
# was suspended on that night):
# https://web.archive.org/web/20140104053304/https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=60267

# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2005-06-11):
# The Herning Folkeblad (1980-09-26) reported that the night between
# Saturday and Sunday the clock is set back from three to two.

# From Paul Eggert (2005-06-11):
# Hence the "02:00" of the 1980 law refers to standard time, not
# wall-clock time, and so the EU rules were in effect in 1980.

# Isle of Man
#
# From Lester Caine (2013-09-04):
# The Isle of Man legislation is now on-line at
# <https://www.legislation.gov.im>, starting with the original Statutory
# Time Act in 1883 and including additional confirmation of some of
# the dates of the 'Summer Time' orders originating at
# Westminster.  There is a little uncertainty as to the starting date
# of the first summer time in 1916 which may have been announced a
# couple of days late.  There is still a substantial number of
# documents to work through, but it is thought that every GB change
# was also implemented on the island.

# Sweden

# From Ivan Nilsson (2001-04-13), superseding Shanks & Pottenger:
#
# The law "Svensk författningssamling 1878, no 14" about standard time in 1879:
# From the beginning of 1879 (that is 01-01 00:00) the time for all
# places in the country is "the mean solar time for the meridian at
# three degrees, or twelve minutes of time, to the west of the
# meridian of the Observatory of Stockholm".  The law is dated 1878-05-31.
#
# The observatory at that time had the meridian 18° 03' 30"
# eastern longitude = 01:12:14 in time.  Less 12 minutes gives the
# national standard time as 01:00:14 ahead of GMT....
#
# About the beginning of CET in Sweden. The lawtext ("Svensk
# författningssamling 1899, no 44") states, that "from the beginning
# of 1900... ... the same as the mean solar time for the meridian at
# the distance of one hour of time from the meridian of the English
# observatory at Greenwich, or at 12 minutes 14 seconds to the west
# from the meridian of the Observatory of Stockholm". The law is dated
# 1899-06-16.  In short: At 1900-01-01 00:00:00 the new standard time
# in Sweden is 01:00:00 ahead of GMT.
#
# 1916: The lawtext ("Svensk författningssamling 1916, no 124") states
# that "1916-05-15 is considered to begin one hour earlier". It is
# pretty obvious that at 05-14 23:00 the clocks are set to 05-15 00:00....
# Further the law says, that "1916-09-30 is considered to end one hour later".
#
# The laws regulating [DST] are available on the site of the Swedish
# Parliament beginning with 1985 - the laws regulating 1980/1984 are
# not available on the site (to my knowledge they are only available
# in Swedish): <http://www.riksdagen.se/english/work/sfst.asp> (type
# "sommartid" without the quotes in the field "Fritext" and then click
# the Sök-button).
#
# (2001-05-13):
#
# I have now found a newspaper stating that at 1916-10-01 01:00
# summertime the church-clocks etc were set back one hour to show
# 1916-10-01 00:00 standard time.  The article also reports that some
# people thought the switch to standard time would take place already
# at 1916-10-01 00:00 summer time, but they had to wait for another
# hour before the event took place.
#

# From Vernice Anderson, Personal Secretary to Philip Jessup,
# US Ambassador At Large (oral history interview, 1971-02-02):
#
# Saturday, the 14th [of October, 1950] - ...  The time was all the
# more confusing at that point, because we had crossed the
# International Date Line, thus getting two Sundays.  Furthermore, we
# discovered that Wake Island had two hours of daylight saving time
# making calculation of time in Washington difficult if not almost
# impossible.

# We have no other report of DST in Wake Island, so omit this info for now.
