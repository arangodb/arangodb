Please report any sensitive security-related bugs via email to the
tzdb designated coordinators, currently Paul Eggert
<eggert@cs.ucla.edu> and Tim Parenti <tim@timtimeonline.com>.
Put "tzdb security" at the start of your email's subject line.
We prefer communications to be in English.

You should receive a response within a week. If not, please follow up
via email to make sure we received your original message.

If we confirm the bug, we plan to notify affected third-party services
or software that we know about, prepare an advisory, commit fixes to
the main development branch as quickly as is practical, and finally
publish the advisory on tz@iana.org.  As with all tzdb contributions,
we give credit to security contributors unless they wish to remain
anonymous.
