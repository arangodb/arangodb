=head1 NAME

XML::LibXML::Attr - XML::LibXML Attribute Class

=head1 SYNOPSIS



  use XML::LibXML;
  # Only methods specific to Attribute nodes are listed here,
  # see XML::LibXML::Node manpage for other methods

  $attr = XML::LibXML::Attr->new($name [,$value]);
  $string = $attr->getValue();
  $string = $attr->value;
  $attr->setValue( $string );
  $node = $attr->getOwnerElement();
  $attr->setNamespace($nsURI, $prefix);
  $bool = $attr->isId;
  $string = $attr->serializeContent;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the interface to handle Attributes like ordinary nodes. The naming of
the class relies on the W3C DOM documentation.


=head1 METHODS

The class inherits from L<<<<<< Abstract Base Class of XML::LibXML Nodes|Abstract Base Class of XML::LibXML Nodes >>>>>>. The documentation for Inherited methods is not listed here. 

Many functions listed here are extensively documented in the L<<<<<< DOM Level 3 specification|http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Core/ >>>>>>. Please refer to the specification for extensive documentation.

=item B<new>

  $attr = XML::LibXML::Attr->new($name [,$value]);

Class constructor. If you need to work with ISO encoded strings, you should I<<<<<< always >>>>>> use the C<<<<<< createAttrbute >>>>>> of L<<<<<< XML::LibXML DOM Document Class|XML::LibXML DOM Document Class >>>>>>.


=item B<getValue>

  $string = $attr->getValue();

Returns the value stored for the attribute. If undef is returned, the attribute
has no value, which is different of being C<<<<<< not specified >>>>>>.


=item B<value>

  $string = $attr->value;

Alias for I<<<<<< getValue() >>>>>>


=item B<setValue>

  $attr->setValue( $string );

This is needed to set a new attribute value. If ISO encoded strings are passed
as parameter, the node has to be bound to a document, otherwise the encoding
might be done incorrectly.


=item B<getOwnerElement>

  $node = $attr->getOwnerElement();

returns the node the attribute belongs to. If the attribute is not bound to a
node, undef will be returned. Overwriting the underlying implementation, the I<<<<<< parentNode >>>>>> function will return undef, instead of the owner element.


=item B<setNamespace>

  $attr->setNamespace($nsURI, $prefix);

This function tries to bound the attribute to a given namespace. If C<<<<<< $nsURI >>>>>> is undefined or empty, the function discards any previous association of the
attribute with a namespace. If the namespace was not previously declared in the
context of the attribute, this function will fail. In this case you may wish to
call setNamespace() on the ownerElement. If the namespace URI is non-empty and
declared in the context of the attribute, but only with a different (non-empty)
prefix, then the attribute is still bound to the namespace but gets a different
prefix than C<<<<<< $prefix >>>>>>. The function also fails if the prefix is empty but the namespace URI is not
(because unprefixed attributes should by definition belong to no namespace).
This function returns 1 on success, 0 otherwise. 


=item B<isId>

  $bool = $attr->isId;

Determine whether an attribute is of type ID. For documents with a DTD, this
information is only available if DTD loading/validation has been requested. For
HTML documents parsed with the HTML parser ID detection is done automatically.
In XML documents, all "xml:id" attributes are considered to be of type ID. 


=item B<serializeContent($docencoding)>

  $string = $attr->serializeContent;

This function is not part of DOM API. It returns attribute content in the form
in which it serializes into XML, that is with all meta-characters properly
quoted and with raw entity references (except for entities expanded during
parse time). Setting the optional $docencoding flag to 1 enforces document
encoding for the output string (which is then passed to Perl as a byte string).
Otherwise the string is passed to Perl as (UTF-8 encoded) characters.
