=head1 Binary distribution from HP

The simplest way to obtain Perl for the MPE/iX is to go either of
these URLs and follow the instructions within.

=head1 What's New in Perl for MPE/iX

January 12, 2006

=over 4

=item *

Updated for perl-5.8.8 and perl-5.9.3 by Ken Hirsch.

Simplified the build process by using the MPEAUTOCONF
functionality in Mark Klein's ld.

If you build this from scratch, make sure you have a version
of ld which supports it.  In the shell, type

  ld --help
    and look for AUTOCONF or MPEAUTOCONF near the bottom

  or do this:
  ld --help 2>&1 | grep AUTOCONF

If you see don't see AUTOCONF or MPEAUTOCONF, make sure you get a new
version.

You also do not have to use mpeix/relink after building, so the
recommend sequence is:

  ./Configure -de

      # or ./Configure -de -Dusedevel 
      # if you're building a development version

  make
  make test
     # if you run this in a job, do "make test_notty"

  make install

Be prepared for a wait. These take much longer on MPE/iX than on a Unix
system, because of a slow forking, mostly.  On a lightly-loaded HP3000
Series 979 running MPE/iX 7.5:

    Configure: 1 hour
    make:      1 hour 15 minutes
    make test  1 hour 45 minutes

Various socket problems were fixed in mpeix.c.

Mark Klein provided a fixed sigsetjmp (that works with dynamic
libraries) in mpeix_setjmp.c

=item *

Rebuilt to be compatible with mod_perl.  If you plan on using
mod_perl, you MUST download and install this version of Perl/iX!

=item *

uselargefiles="undef": not available in MPE for POSIX files yet.

=item *

Now bundled with various add-on packages:

=over 8

=item *

libnet (as seen on CPAN)

=item *

libwww-perl (LWP) which lets Perl programs behave like web browsers:

    1. #!/PERL/PUB/perl
    2. use LWP::Simple;
    3. $doc = get('http://www.bixby.org/mark/perlix.html');  # reads the
       web page into variable $doc

(http://www.bixby.org/mark/perlix.html)

=item *

mod_perl (just the perl portion; the actual DSO will be released
soon with Apache/iX 1.3.12 from bixby.org).  This module allows you to
write high performance persistent Perl CGI scripts and all sorts of
cool things. (http://perl.apache.org/)

and much much more hiding under /PERL/PUB/.cpan/

=item *

The CPAN module now works for automatic downloading and
installing of add-on packages:

    1. export FTP_PASSIVE=1
    2. perl -MCPAN -e shell
    3. Ignore any terminal I/O related complaints!

(http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/CPAN/data/perl/CPAN.html)

May 20, 2000

=item *

Updated to version 5.6.0.  Builds straight out of the box on MPE/iX.

=item *

Perl's getpwnam() function which had regressed to being
unimplemented on MPE is now implemented once again.

=head1 Welcome to Perl/iX

This is the official home page for the HP e3000 MPE/iX
( http://www.hp.com/go/e3000 ) port of the Perl scripting
language ( http://www.perl.com/ ) which gives you all of the power of C,
awk, sed, and sh in a single language. Check here for the latest news,
implemented functionality, known bugs, to-do list, etc. Status reports
about major milestones will also be posted to the HP3000-L mailing list
( http://www.lsoft.com/scripts/wl.exe?SL1=HP3000-L&H=RAVEN.UTC.EDU ) and
its associated gatewayed newsgroup comp.sys.hp.mpe.

I'm doing this port because I can't live without Perl on the Unix
machines that I administer, and I want to have the same power
available to me on MPE.

Please send your comments, questions, and bug reports directly to me,
Mark Bixby ( http://www.bixby.org/mark/ ). Or just post them to HP3000-L.

The platform I'm using to do this port is an HP 3000 957RX running
MPE/iX 6.0 and using the GNU gcc C compiler
( http://jazz.external.hp.com/src/gnu/gnuframe.html ).

The combined porting wisdom from all of my ports can be found in my
MPE/iX Porting Guide (http://www.bixby.org/mark/porting.html).

IMPORTANT NOTICE: Yes, I do work for the HP CSY R&D lab, but ALL of
the software you download from bixby.org is my personal freeware that
is NOT supported by HP.

=head1 System Requirements for Perl/iX

=over 4

=item *

MPE/iX 5.5 or later. This version of Perl/iX does NOT run on
MPE/iX 5.0 or earlier, nor does it run on "classic" MPE/V machines.

=item *

If you wish to recompile Perl, you must install both GNUCORE and
GNUGCC from jazz (http://jazz.external.hp.com/src/gnu/gnuframe.html).

=item *

Perl/iX will be happier on MPE/iX 5.5 if you install the MPEKX40B
extended POSIX filename characters patch, but this is optional.

=item *

Patch LBCJXT6A is required on MPE/iX 5.5 machines in order to
prevent Perl/iX from dying with an unresolved external reference
to _getenv_libc.

=item *

If you will be compiling Perl/iX yourself, you will also need
Syslog/iX ( http://www.bixby.org/mark/syslogix.html ) and the
/BIND/PUB/include and /BIND/PUB/lib portions of BIND/iX
( http://www.bixby.org/mark/bindix.html ).

=back

=head1 How to Obtain Perl/iX

=over 4

=item 1.

Download Perl using either FTP.ARPA.SYS or some other client

=item 2.

Extract the installation script

=item 3.

Edit the installation script

=item 4.

Run the installation script

=item 5.

Convert your *.a system archive libraries to *.sl shared libraries

=back

Download Perl using FTP.ARPA.SYS from your HP 3000 (the preferred
method).....

    :HELLO MANAGER.SYS
    :XEQ FTP.ARPA.SYS
    open ftp.bixby.org
    anonymous
    your@email.address
    bytestream
    cd /pub/mpe
    get perl-5.6.0-mpe.tar.Z /tmp/perl.tar.Z;disc=2147483647
    exit

.....Or download using some other generic web or ftp client (the alternate
method)

Download the following files (make sure that you use "binary mode" or
whatever client feature that is 8-bit clean):

=over 4

=item *

Perl from

    http://www.bixby.org/ftp/pub/mpe/perl-5.6.0-mpe.tar.Z

or

    ftp://ftp.bixby.org/pub/mpe/perl-5.6.0-mpe.tar.Z

=item *

Upload those files to your HP 3000 in an 8-bit clean bytestream manner to:

    /tmp/perl.tar.Z

=item *

Then extract the installation script (after both download methods)

    :CHDIR /tmp
    :XEQ TAR.HPBIN.SYS 'xvfopz /tmp/perl.tar.Z INSTALL'

=item *

Edit the installation script

Examine the accounting structure creation commands and modify if
necessary (adding additional capabilities, choosing a non-system
volume set, etc).

    :XEQ VI.HPBIN.SYS /tmp/INSTALL

=item *

Run the installation script.

The accounting structure will be created and then all files will be
extracted from the archive.

    :XEQ SH.HPBIN.SYS /tmp/INSTALL

=item *

Convert your *.a system archive libraries to *.sl shared libraries

You only have to do this ONCE on your MPE/iX 5.5 machine in order to
convert /lib/lib*.a and /usr/lib/lib*.a libraries to their *.sl
equivalents.  This step should not be necessary on MPE/iX 6.0 or later
machines because the 6.0 or later update process does it for you.

    :XEQ SH.HPBIN.SYS /PERL/PUB/LIBSHP3K

=head1 Getting Started with Perl/iX

Create your Perl script files with "#!/PERL/PUB/perl" (or an
equivalent symbolic link) as the first line.  Use the chmod command to
make sure that your script has execute permission. Run your script!

Be sure to take a look at the CPAN module list
( http://www.cpan.org/CPAN.html ). A wide variety of free Perl software
is available.  You can automatically download these packages by using
the CPAN module ( http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/CPAN/data/perl/CPAN.html ).

=head1 MPE/iX Implementation Considerations

There some minor functionality issues to be aware of when comparing
Perl for Unix (Perl/UX) to Perl/iX:

=over 4

=item *

MPE gcc/ld doesn't properly support linking NMPRG executables against
NMXL dynamic libraries, so you must manually run mpeix/relink after
each re-build of Perl.

=item *

Perl/iX File::Copy will use MPE's /bin/cp command to copy files by
name in order to preserve file attributes like file code.

=item *

MPE (and thus Perl/iX) lacks support for setgrent(), endgrent(),
setpwent(), endpwent().

=item *

MPE (and thus Perl/iX) lacks support for hard links.

=item *

MPE requires GETPRIVMODE() in order to bind() to ports less than 1024.
Perl/iX will call GETPRIVMODE() automatically on your behalf if you
attempt to bind() to these low-numbered ports.  Note that the Perl/iX
executable and the PERL account do not normally have CAP=PM, so if you
will be bind()-ing to these privileged ports, you will manually need
to add PM capability as appropriate.

=item *

MPE requires that you bind() to an IP address of zero.  Perl/iX
automatically replaces the IP address that you pass to bind() with
a zero.

=item *

MPE requires GETPRIVMODE() in order to setuid().  There are too many
calls to setuid() within Perl/iX, so I have not attempted an automatic
GETPRIVMODE() solution similar to bind().

=back

=head1 Known Perl/iX Bugs Under Investigation

None.

=head1 Perl/iX To-Do List

=over 4

=item *

Make setuid()/setgid() support work.

=item *

Make sure that fcntl() against a socket descriptor is redirected to sfcntl().

=item *

Add support for Berkeley DB once I've finished porting Berkeley DB.

=item *

Write an MPE XS extension library containing miscellaneous important
MPE functions like GETPRIVMODE(), GETUSERMODE(), and sfcntl().
