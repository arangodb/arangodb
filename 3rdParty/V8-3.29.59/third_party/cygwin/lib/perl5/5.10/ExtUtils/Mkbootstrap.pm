=head1 NAME

ExtUtils::Mkbootstrap - make a bootstrap file for use by DynaLoader

=head1 SYNOPSIS

C<Mkbootstrap>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Mkbootstrap typically gets called from an extension Makefile.

There is no C<*.bs> file supplied with the extension. Instead, there may
be a C<*_BS> file which has code for the special cases, like posix for
berkeley db on the NeXT.

This file will get parsed, and produce a maybe empty
C<@DynaLoader::dl_resolve_using> array for the current architecture.
That will be extended by $BSLOADLIBS, which was computed by
ExtUtils::Liblist::ext(). If this array still is empty, we do nothing,
else we write a .bs file with an C<@DynaLoader::dl_resolve_using>
array.

The C<*_BS> file can put some code into the generated C<*.bs> file by
placing it in C<$bscode>. This is a handy 'escape' mechanism that may
prove useful in complex situations.

If @DynaLoader::dl_resolve_using contains C<-L*> or C<-l*> entries then
Mkbootstrap will automatically add a dl_findfile() call to the
generated C<*.bs> file.
