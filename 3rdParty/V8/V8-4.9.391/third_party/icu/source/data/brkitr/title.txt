#  If the iterator begins on a CaseIgnorable, advance it past it/them.

#  safe-reverse rule.

($CaseIgnorable | $NotCased)*;

#   Normal exact forward rule: beginning at the start of a word
#         (at a cased character), advance through the word and through
#         the uncased characters following the word.

$Cased ($Cased | $CaseIgnorable)* ($NotCased | $CaseIgnorable)*;


#  Reverse Rules
!!reverse;

#  Normal Rule, will work nearly universally, so long as there is a
#    start-of-word preceding the current iteration position.

($NotCased | $CaseIgnorable)* ($Cased | $CaseIgnorable)* $Cased;

#  Short rule, will be effective only when moving to the start of text,
#    with no word (cased character) preceding the current iteration position.

($NotCased | $CaseIgnorable)*;

!!safe_reverse;

# Safe Reverse: the exact forward rule must not start in the middle
#  of a word, so the safe reverse skips over any Cased characters,
#  leaving it just before the start of a word.

($Cased | $CaseIgnorable)*;

!!safe_forward;

# Safe Forward, nothing needs to be done, the exact Reverse rules will
#   always find valid boundaries from any starting position.
#   Still, some rule is needed, so '.', a one character movement.
