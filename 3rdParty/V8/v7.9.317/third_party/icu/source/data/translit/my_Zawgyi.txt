# This transform converts Unicode Burmese text into Zawgyi font encoded
# form. Zawgyi is a popular, non-standard encoding scheme in Myanmar
# that uses the same code range as Myanmar Unicode but assigns different
# characters or glyphs to some codepoints. In addition to character remapping,
# context-based reordering of codepoints is needed to give readable
# output when the output is displayed with a Zawgyi font such as
# ZawgyiOne.ttf or ZawgyiOne2008.ttf.
#
# The transform is done in two main stages:
# (1) Map all Unicode codepoints to their Zawgyi counterparts.
# (2) Perform reordering.
# Modern Burmese digits & Unicode code points.
