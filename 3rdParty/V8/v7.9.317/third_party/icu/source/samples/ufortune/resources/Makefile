#
# Usage:
#    See the instructions in the parent Makefile,
#          icu/source/samples/ufortune/Makefile.
#          This subproject builds the ICU resource files for ufortune.
#          It is normally invoked from the parent directory,
#            although the resources can be built from here.
#
#    Two ICU tools are run from this makefile:
#      genrb    compiles a resource source file (.txt) into
#               a binary .res file.
#      pkgdata  combines all of the .res files into a single
#               shared library that can then be linked with the
#               main application.
#
#               pkgdata will recursively generate and run yet
#               another makefile, which in turn runs two more
#               icu tools.  gencmn combines the individual .res
#               files, and genccode emits the data as C source
#               code that can then be built into a .so
#
