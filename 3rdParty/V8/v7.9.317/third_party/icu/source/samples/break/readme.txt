break: Boundary Analysis

This sample demonstrates
         Using ICU to determine the linguistic boundaries within text

         
Files:
    break.cpp      Main source file in C++
    ubreak.c       Main source file in C
    break.sln      Windows MSVC workspace.  Double-click this to get started.
    break.vcproj   Windows MSVC project file

To Build break on Windows
    1.  Install and build ICU
    2.  In MSVC, open the workspace file icu\samples\break\break.sln
    3.  Choose a Debug or Release build.
    4.  Build.
	
To Run on Windows
    1.  Start a command shell window
    2.  Add ICU's bin directory to the path, e.g.
            set PATH=c:\icu\bin;%PATH%
        (Use the path to where ever ICU is on your system.)
    3.  cd into the break directory, e.g.
            cd c:\icu\source\samples\break\debug
    4.  Run it (Warning: Be careful, 'break' is also a system command on many systems)
            .\break

To Build on Unixes
    1.  Build ICU.  
        Specify an ICU install directory when running configure,
        using the --prefix option.  The steps to build ICU will look something
        like this:
           cd <icu directory>/source
           runConfigureICU <platform-name> --prefix <icu install directory> [other options]
           gmake all
           
    2.  Install ICU, 
           gmake install
 
    3.  Compile
           cd <icu directory>/source/samples/break
           gmake ICU_PREFIX=<icu install directory)
           
 To Run on Unixes
           cd <icu directory>/source/samples/break
           
           gmake ICU_PREFIX=<icu install directory>  check
               -or- 

           export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<icu install directory>/lib:.:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
           break
           
           
 Note:  The name of the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable is different on some systems.
        If in doubt, run the sample using "gmake check", and note the name of
        the variable that is used there.  LD_LIBRARY_PATH is the correct name
        for Linux and Solaris.
