convsamp: a sample program which demonstrates using ICU conversion

This sample demonstrates
         Opening and closing converters using the C api
         String manipulation in C 
         Writing a custom conversion callback function

    convsamp.c                 Main source file
    flagcb.h                   codepage output convenience header
    flagcb.c                   codepage output convenience implementation
    ucnv.sln                   Windows MSVC workspace.  Double-click this to get started.
    ucnv.vcproj                Windows MSVC project file

To Build ucnv on Windows
    1.  Install and build ICU
    2.  In MSVC, open the workspace file icu\samples\ucnv\ucnv.sln
    3.  Choose a Debug or Release build.
    4.  Build.
	
To Run on Windows
    1.  Start a command shell window
    2.  Add ICU's bin directory to the path, e.g.
            set PATH=c:\icu\bin;%PATH%
        (Use the path to where ever ICU is on your system.)
    3.  cd into the ufortune directory, e.g.
            cd c:\icu\source\samples\ucnv\debug
    4.  Run it
            ucnv
    WARNING: The .bin and .txt files must be in the same directory as the executable, which is not the case by default on some systems.

To Build on Unixes
    1.  Build ICU.  
        Specify an ICU install directory when running configure,
        using the --prefix option.  The steps to build ICU will look something
        like this:
           cd <icu directory>/source
           runConfigureICU <platform-name> --prefix <icu install directory> [other options]
           gmake all
           
    2.  Install ICU, 
           gmake install

    3.  Build 
           set the variable ICU_PREFIX=<icu install>
           gmake all
           
 To Run on Unixes
           cd <icu directory>/source/samples/ucnv
           
           gmake check
               -or- 

           export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<icu install directory>/lib:.:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
           convsamp
           
           
 Note:  The name of the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable is different on some systems.
        If in doubt, run the sample using "gmake check", and note the name of
        the variable that is used there.  LD_LIBRARY_PATH is the correct name
        for Linux and Solaris.
