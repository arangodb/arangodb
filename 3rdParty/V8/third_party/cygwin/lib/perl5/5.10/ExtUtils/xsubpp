=head1 NAME

xsubpp - compiler to convert Perl XS code into C code

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<xsubpp> [B<-v>] [B<-except>] [B<-s pattern>] [B<-prototypes>] [B<-noversioncheck>] [B<-nolinenumbers>] [B<-nooptimize>] [B<-typemap typemap>] [B<-output filename>]... file.xs

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This compiler is typically run by the makefiles created by L<ExtUtils::MakeMaker>.

I<xsubpp> will compile XS code into C code by embedding the constructs
necessary to let C functions manipulate Perl values and creates the glue
necessary to let Perl access those functions.  The compiler uses typemaps to
determine how to map C function parameters and variables to Perl values.

The compiler will search for typemap files called I<typemap>.  It will use
the following search path to find default typemaps, with the rightmost
typemap taking precedence.

	../../../typemap:../../typemap:../typemap:typemap

It will also use a default typemap installed as C<ExtUtils::typemap>.

=head1 OPTIONS

Note that the C<XSOPT> MakeMaker option may be used to add these options to
any makefiles generated by MakeMaker.

=over 5

=item B<-hiertype>

Retains '::' in type names so that C++ hierarchical types can be mapped.

=item B<-except>

Adds exception handling stubs to the C code.

=item B<-typemap typemap>

Indicates that a user-supplied typemap should take precedence over the
default typemaps.  This option may be used multiple times, with the last
typemap having the highest precedence.

=item B<-output filename>

Specifies the name of the output file to generate.  If no file is
specified, output will be written to standard output.

=item B<-v>

Prints the I<xsubpp> version number to standard output, then exits.

=item B<-prototypes>

By default I<xsubpp> will not automatically generate prototype code for
all xsubs. This flag will enable prototypes.

=item B<-noversioncheck>

Disables the run time test that determines if the object file (derived
from the C<.xs> file) and the C<.pm> files have the same version
number.

=item B<-nolinenumbers>

Prevents the inclusion of `#line' directives in the output.

=item B<-nooptimize>

Disables certain optimizations.  The only optimization that is currently
affected is the use of I<target>s by the output C code (see L<perlguts>).
This may significantly slow down the generated code, but this is the way
B<xsubpp> of 5.005 and earlier operated.

=item B<-noinout>

Disable recognition of C<IN>, C<OUT_LIST> and C<INOUT_LIST> declarations.

=item B<-noargtypes>

Disable recognition of ANSI-like descriptions of function signature.

=item B<-C++>

Currently doesn't do anything at all.  This flag has been a no-op for
many versions of perl, at least as far back as perl5.003_07.  It's
allowed here for backwards compatibility.
