=head2 perltrap - Perl traps for the unwary

=over 4

=item DESCRIPTION

=over 4

=item Awk Traps

=item C/C++ Traps

=item Sed Traps

=item Shell Traps

=item Perl Traps

=item Perl4 to Perl5 Traps

Discontinuance, Deprecation, and BugFix traps, Parsing Traps, Numerical
Traps, General data type traps, Context Traps - scalar, list contexts,
Precedence Traps, General Regular Expression Traps using s///, etc,
Subroutine, Signal, Sorting Traps, OS Traps, DBM Traps, Unclassified Traps

=item Discontinuance, Deprecation, and BugFix traps

Symbols starting with "_" no longer forced into main, Double-colon valid
package separator in variable name, 2nd and 3rd args to C<splice()> are now
in scalar context, Can't do C<goto> into a block that is optimized away,
Can't use whitespace as variable name or quote delimiter, C<while/if BLOCK
BLOCK> gone, C<**> binds tighter than unary minus, C<foreach> changed when
iterating over a list, C<split> with no args behavior changed, B<-e>
behavior fixed, C<push> returns number of elements in resulting list, Some
error messages differ, C<split()> honors subroutine args, Bugs removed

=item Parsing Traps

Space between . and = triggers syntax error, Better parsing in perl 5,
Function parsing, String interpolation of C<$#array> differs, Perl guesses
on C<map>, C<grep> followed by C<{> if it starts BLOCK or hash ref

=item Numerical Traps

Formatted output and significant digits, Auto-increment operator over
signed int limit deleted, Assignment of return values from numeric equality
tests doesn't work, Bitwise string ops

=item General data type traps

Negative array subscripts now count from the end of array, Setting
C<$#array> lower now discards array elements, Hashes get defined before
use, Glob assignment from localized variable to variable, Assigning
C<undef> to glob, Changes in unary negation (of strings), Modifying of
constants prohibited, C<defined $var> behavior changed, Variable Suicide

=item Context Traps - scalar, list contexts

Elements of argument lists for formats evaluated in list context,
C<caller()> returns false value in scalar context if no caller present,
Comma operator in scalar context gives scalar context to args, C<sprintf()>
prototyped as C<($;@)>

=item Precedence Traps

LHS vs. RHS of any assignment operator, Semantic errors introduced due to
precedence, Precedence of assignment operators same as the precedence of
assignment, C<open> requires parentheses around filehandle, C<$:>
precedence over C<$::> gone, Precedence of file test operators documented,
C<keys>, C<each>, C<values> are regular named unary operators

=item General Regular Expression Traps using s///, etc.

C<s'$lhs'$rhs'> interpolates on either side, C<m//g> attaches its state to
the searched string, C<m//o> used within an anonymous sub, C<$+> isn't set
to whole match, Substitution now returns null string if it fails,
C<s`lhs`rhs`> is now a normal substitution, Stricter parsing of variables
in regular expressions, C<m?x?> matches only once, Failed matches don't
reset the match variables

=item Subroutine, Signal, Sorting Traps

Barewords that used to look like strings look like subroutine calls,
Reverse is no longer allowed as the name of a sort subroutine, C<warn()>
won't let you specify a filehandle

=item OS Traps

SysV resets signal handler correctly, SysV C<seek()> appends correctly

=item Interpolation Traps

C<@> always interpolates an array in double-quotish strings, Double-quoted
strings may no longer end with an unescaped $, Arbitrary expressions are
evaluated inside braces within double quotes, C<$$x> now tries to
dereference $x, Creation of hashes on the fly with C<eval "EXPR"> requires
protection, Bugs in earlier perl versions, Array and hash brackets during
interpolation, Interpolation of C<\$$foo{bar}>, C<qq()> string passed to
C<eval> will not find string terminator

=item DBM Traps

Perl5 must have been linked with same dbm/ndbm as the default for
C<dbmopen()>, DBM exceeding limit on the key/value size will cause perl5 to
exit immediately

=item Unclassified Traps

C<require>/C<do> trap using returned value, C<split> on empty string with
LIMIT specified

=item DESCRIPTION

Does concept match the general goals of Perl?, Where is the
implementation?, Backwards compatibility, Could it be a module instead?, Is
the feature generic enough?, Does it potentially introduce new bugs?, Does
it preclude other desirable features?, Is the implementation robust?, Is
the implementation generic enough to be portable?, Is the implementation
tested?, Is there enough documentation?, Is there another way to do it?,
Does it create too much work?, Patches speak louder than words

=item FAQ

What's the minimum perl version required to run Archive::Tar?, Isn't
Archive::Tar slow?, Isn't Archive::Tar heavier on memory than /bin/tar?,
Can't you lazy-load data instead?, How much memory will an X kb tar file
need?, What do you do with unsupported filetypes in an archive?, I'm using
WinZip, or some other non-POSIX client, and files are not being extracted
properly!, How do I extract only files that have property X from an
archive?, How do I access .tar.Z files?, How do I handle Unicode strings?

=item TODO

Check if passed in handles are open for read/write, Allow archives to be
passed in as string, Facilitate processing an opened filehandle of a
compressed archive

How do I install a module into my home directory?, How do I get MakeMaker
and Module::Build to install to the same place?, How do I keep from
installing man pages?, How do I use a module without installing it?, PREFIX
vs INSTALL_BASE from Module::Build::Cookbook

=item Philosophy and History

Why not just use <insert other build config tool here>?, What is
Module::Build and how does it relate to MakeMaker?, pure perl.	no make, no
shell commands, easier to customize, cleaner internals, less cruft

=item Module Writing

How do I keep my $VERSION up to date without resetting it manually?, What's
this F<META.yml> thing and how did it get in my F<MANIFEST>?!, How do I
delete everything not in my F<MANIFEST>?

=item XS

How to I prevent "object version X.XX does not match bootstrap parameter
Y.YY" errors?, How do I make two or more XS files coexist in the same

=item The Problem

=item Disabling or changing <no> behaviour

=item Filtering only specific components of source code

C<"executable_no_comments">, C<"quotelike">, C<"string">, C<"regex">,
C<"all">

=item Filtering only the code parts of source code

Most source code ceases to be grammatically correct when it is broken up
into the pieces between string literals and regexes. So the C<'code'>
and C<'code_no_comments'> component filter behave slightly differently
from the other partial filters described in the previous section.

1. Using C<auto_features>, I check to see whether two optional modules are
available - SVN::Notify::Config and Net::SSH;, 2. If the S::N::Config
module is loaded, I automatically generate testfiles for it during Build
(using the C<PL_files> property), 3. If the C<ssh_feature> is available, I
ask if the user wishes to perform the ssh tests (since it requires a little
preliminary setup);, 4. Only if the user has C<ssh_feature> and answers yes
to the testing, do I generate a test file
