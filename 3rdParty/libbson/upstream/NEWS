Libbson 0.6.4
=============

This is just a followup release of libbson as we work towards stablizing for
the new mongo-c-driver release. In fact, it only includes build work and a
new macro, bson_clear().

Happy hacking!


Libbson 0.6.2
=============

A new Libbson release is already here as a follow up to the 0.6.0 release.

This release includes a few build and installation fixes. In particular,

 * Windows build fixes
 * CMake build fixes
 * C++ build fixes.

The monotonic clock is now more accurately calculated on Windows as well.
If you'd like to build on Windows, check out the section in README.md for
information on how to do so.

Happy hacking!


Libbson 0.6.0
=============

Many changes have gone into this release!

TL;DR

 * C99 types (from C89).
 * JSON parsing.
 * Lots of Operating System support, including Windows.
 * Parallel Test Suite.
 * Revamped build system.
 * A couple ABI breaks.

First off, 0.6.0 has gone through a significant amount of build system cleanup.
This should simplify using libbson as a submodule for those that wish to do so.
For example, the mongo-c-driver now does this using autotools.

Windows Vista and higher is now supported as a build target through the use of
cmake. See README.md for the instructions. Other platforms should continue to
use autotools.

The test suite has been improved and more tests added. We now generate random
seeds on every run to help catch more errors with additional fuzzing passes.
By default, the test suite will run all tests in parallel with subprocesses.
This should speed up execution of `make test' for contributors.

bson_string_t went through an ABI break to support power-of-two growth.

JSON parsing has been added through the bson_json_reader_t type. You can also
now use bson_init_from_json() for a simplified interface.

Types were revamped to appear to be using C99 types. If C99 types are
available, they will be used. If not, they will be emulated. This means you
can just go on using uint64_t and similar. We even use bool now.

Many functions have been made portable to deal with inconsistencies with Win32.

This release has been tested on the following operating systems:

 * RedHat Enterprise 5, 6, and 7 beta.
 * CentOS 6.5
 * Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 * Fedora 20
 * Windows 7
 * FreeBSD 10
 * DragonFly BSD
 * Solaris 11
 * SmartOS
 * mingw64

Thanks again and enjoy using libbson!

Libbson 0.4.0
=============

This release includes a few bug fixes and copious documentation. Additionally,
we improved our fuzz testing and found a couple issues in the process.  It is
suggested that everyone upgrade their installations to 0.4.0.

We have been busy adding a lot of documentation that we hope you will like.
Many `man' pages have been added for various API endpoints and structures.  If
you use vim, remember that you can jump to the documentation with <shift>k
while on a symbol.

Thanks and enjoy using libbson!

Libbson 0.2.4
=============

This release includes some more performance improvements and bug fixes.

It contains an important fix for dealing with invalid string lengths that could
cause an integer overflow when checking to see if the string length fits within
the end of the buffer.

There is preliminary support for Solaris on x86_64 and SPARC.

Generating OIDs is now simpler with the use of bson_context_get_default(). This
function will return a thread-safe generic bson_context_t implementation.
Alternatively, you may pass NULL to bson_oid_init() for the context and the
default context is automatically used.

The fuzz tests now use srand() with a 32-bit integer derived from /dev/urandom.

Endianess conversions are now performed by __builtin_bswap*() functions when
available with the GCC compiler.

Endianness conversions for the double type are now properly handled on
big-endian systems.

bson_reinit() has been added to cleanup code that needs to destroy and then
initialize a bson_t.

Validation of Code with Scope fields was absent from bson_validate(). This is
now supported.

Libbson 0.2.2
=============

This release includes a few performance improvements and bug fixes.

The bson_t structure is more efficient when growing allocated buffers.
The use of memalign() was unnecessary for allocated bson_t structures
and has therefore been removed. Performance sensitive allocations now
use bson_malloc() instead of calloc() and initialize fields directly.
Stack alignment of bson_t is now enforced through compiler intrinsics.

The unit tests can now support running inside of valgrind to check for
various memory leaks. Simply defing VALGRIND=valgrind when running
`make test`.

Enjoy libbson-0.2.2!


Libbson 0.2.0
=============

This is the initial release of Libbson. It has not yet reached API and ABI
maturity and is therefore subject to change without notice.  Developers are
encouraged to start using Libbson as we journey on the road to 1.0, where ABI
stability will be guaranteed.

Libbson is Apache 2.0 licensed so that it can be embedded in a multitude of
scenarios. This means that we try hard to not rely on external libraries.
Therefore, Libbson contains useful routines to help in portability as well
as BSON support.

Libbson is the basis of a new MongoDB C driver that will follow shortly.

Please see the doc/ directory for documentation on how to use Libbson. We
would love for you to contribute to Libbson, whether that is code,
documentation or packaging.

You can contact Libbson's author, Christian Hergert at
christian.hergert@mongodb.com if you have questions about using Libbson.
