The uconv command is an iconv(1)-like conversion / transcoding
program. Please check its manual page, or run uconv -h, for help.

Help, as well as error messages, are displayed through the use of a

uconv was originally written and contributed to icuapps by Jonas Utterström
<jonas.utterstrom@vittran.norrnod.se>, and offered simple conversion and
a way to know which encodings were available. It has since then be
moved to the main ICU distribution and converted to the C conversion
API, and is maintained by Yves Arrouye <yves@realnames.com> who seems
to always be looking for one more feature or option to add to the tool.
