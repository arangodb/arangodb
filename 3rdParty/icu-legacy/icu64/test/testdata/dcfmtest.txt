#       Decimal formatter test cases.
#       File Encoding:  UTF-8
#
#   The syntax for this file is this:
#   One test case per line.  No continuations.  No multiple cases per line.
#
#   Parsing Test case line:
#     parse "input text"  type "expected_decimal_text" 
#
#   Format Test Case Line:
#     format  pattern round-mode "decimal number" "expected formatted result"
#
#   Fields are separated by spaces or tabs.  Input text to be parsed, decimal numbers
#   and formatted output are "quoted".  Other fields are not.
#
#   "type" is a single letter,  representing the type that the ICU formattable produces
#   for the input.
