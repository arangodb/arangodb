How Expensive Is It?

* Introduction
** The purpose of this test is to answer the question, "How expensive, relatively speaking, is ICU operation X?"
** ICU tests are compared with general purpose CPU operations to attempt to factor out differences between systems and load conditions
** Different ICU operations will have different levels of dependence on CPU, memory, disk, etc. So nothing can perfectly factor these conditions out.
* Running the Test
** Simply run "make check" in this directory, icu/source/test/perf/howExpensiveIs/
** Try to minimize other CPU loading throughout the test
** The test will take some time to run!
** Test runs outside of a margin of error will be thrown out. So, this will tend to produce more accurate results.
** After some time, the file howexpensive.xml will be created (an example is attached as Appendix I)
** The results may be read directly or processed such as with xslt.
** XML file contents:
*** Element <tests>: the outermost element. 
*** Attribute 'icu':  gives the basic ICU version number.
**** Element <test>: a particularized test.
***** Attribute 'name': names the particular test, see howExpensiveIs.cpp for details
***** Attribute 'standardizedTime': The SieveTest by definition has a standardized test of 1, it runs a prime number sieve as a benchmark. All other standardizedTimes are normalized against this value.
***** Attribute 'realDuration': the actual duration, in seconds, of the test.
***** Attribute 'marginOfError': the amount +/- error for the real duration. Gives an idea of how much variability was in the test. 
***** Attribute 'iterations': gives the total number of iterations run.
**** Element <icuSystemParams>: This element gives the full details of the target platform, in the XML format produced by the 'icuinfo' tool.  The contents are informative only and not documented here.
* Analysis
** The data shows that, for example, parsing a number and opening the GB18030 converter are about the same cost. It also shows that opening a number formatter is about 60 times as expensive as formatting a number.
** Appendix II shows a .CSV (spreadsheet) file which shows analysis of a sample run between different systems. 
** The Variation column for each Target system was calculated with the formula:  "(Control-Target)/Control" where Control and Target are the standardized times for the Control and Target systems, respectively.
