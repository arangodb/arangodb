==
* Where can I find more sample code?

 - The "uconv" utility is a full-featured command line application.
    It is normally built with ICU, and is located in icu/source/extra/uconv

 - The "icuapps" CVS module contains other applications and libraries not
    included with ICU.  You can check it out from the CVS command line
    by using for example,  "cvs co icuapps" instead of "cvs co icu",
   or through WebCVS at http://dev.icu-project.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/icuapps/

==
* How do I build the samples?

 - See the Readme in each subdirectory

 To build all samples at once:

    Windows MSVC:   
            - build ICU
	    - open 'all' project file in 'all' subdirectory
            - build project
            - sample executables will be located in /x86/Debug folders of each sample subdirectory

    Unix:   - build and install (make install) ICU
            - be sure 'icu-config' is accessible from the PATH
            - type 'make all-samples' from this directory 
               (other targets:  clean-samples, check-samples)
           Note: 'make all-samples' won't work correctly in out of source builds.

            - legacy and layout are not included in these lists,
                   please see their individual readmes.
