// A Cache is an interface that maps keys to values.  It has internal
// synchronization and may be safely accessed concurrently from
// multiple threads.  It may automatically evict entries to make room
// for new entries.  Values have a specified charge against the cache
// capacity.  For example, a cache where the values are variable
// length strings, may use the length of the string as the charge for
// the string.
//
// A builtin cache implementation with a least-recently-used eviction
// policy is provided.  Clients may use their own implementations if
// they want something more sophisticated (like scan-resistance, a
// custom eviction policy, variable cache sizing, etc.)
