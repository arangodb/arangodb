Over the past 6 months we have seen a number of use cases where RocksDB is successfully used by the community and various companies to achieve high throughput and volume in a modern server environment.

We at Microsoft Bing could not be left behind. As a result we are happy to [announce](http://bit.ly/1OmWBT9) the availability of the Windows Port created here at Microsoft which we intend to use as a storage option for one of our key/value data stores.

We are happy to make this available for the community. Keep tuned for more announcements to come.
