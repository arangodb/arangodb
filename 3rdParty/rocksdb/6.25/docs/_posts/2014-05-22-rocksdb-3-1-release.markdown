Check out the new release on [Github](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/releases/tag/rocksdb-3.1)!

New features in RocksDB 3.1:

  * [Materialized hash index](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/commit/0b3d03d026a7248e438341264b4c6df339edc1d7)


  * [FIFO compaction style](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/FIFO-compaction-style)


We released 3.1 so fast after 3.0 because one of our internal customers needed materialized hash index.
