// run for a long while) or issue many of DB::Put() (as Put may be blocked
// in certain cases) in the same thread in the EventListener callback.

// call EventListener::OnFlushCompleted().

// the current thread holding any DB mutex. This is to prevent potential
// deadlock and performance issue when using EventListener callback
// in a complex way.
