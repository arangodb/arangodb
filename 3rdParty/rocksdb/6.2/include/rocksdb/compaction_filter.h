  // output of this compaction run and a return value of true
  // indicates that this key-value should be removed from the
  // output of the compaction.  The application can inspect
  // the existing value of the key and make decision based on it.
  //
  // Key-Values that are results of merge operation during compaction are not
  // passed into this function. Currently, when you have a mix of Put()s and
  // Merge()s on a same key, we only guarantee to process the merge operands
  // through the compaction filters. Put()s might be processed, or might not.
  //
  // When the value is to be preserved, the application has the option
  // to modify the existing_value and pass it back through new_value.
  // value_changed needs to be set to true in this case.
  //
  // Note that RocksDB snapshots (i.e. call GetSnapshot() API on a
  // DB* object) will not guarantee to preserve the state of the DB with
  // CompactionFilter. Data seen from a snapshot might disppear after a
  // compaction finishes. If you use snapshots, think twice about whether you
  // want to use compaction filter and whether you are using it in a safe way.
  //
  // If multithreaded compaction is being used *and* a single CompactionFilter
  // instance was supplied via Options::compaction_filter, this method may be
  // called from different threads concurrently.  The application must ensure
  // that the call is thread-safe.
  //
  // If the CompactionFilter was created by a factory, then it will only ever
  // be used by a single thread that is doing the compaction run, and this
  // call does not need to be thread-safe.  However, multiple filters may be
  // in existence and operating concurrently.

  // An extended API. Called for both values and merge operands.
  // Allows changing value and skipping ranges of keys.
  // The default implementation uses Filter() and FilterMergeOperand().
  // If you're overriding this method, no need to override the other two.
  // `value_type` indicates whether this key-value corresponds to a normal
  // value (e.g. written with Put())  or a merge operand (written with Merge()).
  //
  // Possible return values:
  //  * kKeep - keep the key-value pair.
  //  * kRemove - remove the key-value pair or merge operand.
  //  * kChangeValue - keep the key and change the value/operand to *new_value.
  //  * kRemoveAndSkipUntil - remove this key-value pair, and also remove
  //      all key-value pairs with key in [key, *skip_until). This range
  //      of keys will be skipped without reading, potentially saving some
  //      IO operations compared to removing the keys one by one.
  //
  //      *skip_until <= key is treated the same as Decision::kKeep
  //      (since the range [key, *skip_until) is empty).
  //
  //      Caveats:
  //       - The keys are skipped even if there are snapshots containing them,
  //         i.e. values removed by kRemoveAndSkipUntil can disappear from a
  //         snapshot - beware if you're using TransactionDB or
  //         DB::GetSnapshot().
  //       - If value for a key was overwritten or merged into (multiple Put()s
  //         or Merge()s), and compaction filter skips this key with
  //         kRemoveAndSkipUntil, it's possible that it will remove only
  //         the new value, exposing the old value that was supposed to be
  //         overwritten.
  //       - Doesn't work with PlainTableFactory in prefix mode.
  //       - If you use kRemoveAndSkipUntil, consider also reducing
  //         compaction_readahead_size option.
  //
  // Note: If you are using a TransactionDB, it is not recommended to filter
  // out or modify merge operands (ValueType::kMergeOperand).
  // If a merge operation is filtered out, TransactionDB may not realize there
  // is a write conflict and may allow a Transaction to Commit that should have
  // failed. Instead, it is better to implement any Merge filtering inside the
  // MergeOperator.
