Q.Score is a measure of quality of the hash function.
It depends on successfully passing SMHasher test set.
10 is a perfect score.

A 64-bit version, named XXH64, is available since r35.
It offers much better speed, but for 64-bit applications only.

/*-**********************************************************************
*  XXH3
*  New experimental hash
************************************************************************/
#ifndef XXH_NO_LONG_LONG


/* ============================================
 * XXH3 is a new hash algorithm,
 * featuring improved speed performance for both small and large inputs.
 * See full speed analysis at : http://fastcompression.blogspot.com/2019/03/presenting-xxh3.html
 * In general, expect XXH3 to run about ~2x faster on large inputs,
 * and >3x faster on small ones, though exact differences depend on platform.
 *
 * The algorithm is portable, will generate the same hash on all platforms.
 * It benefits greatly from vectorization units, but does not require it.
 *
 * XXH3 offers 2 variants, _64bits and _128bits.
 * When only 64 bits are needed, prefer calling the _64bits variant :
 * it reduces the amount of mixing, resulting in faster speed on small inputs.
 * It's also generally simpler to manipulate a scalar return type than a struct.
 *
 * The XXH3 algorithm is still considered experimental.
 * Produced results can still change between versions.
 * Results produced by v0.7.x are not comparable with results from v0.7.y .
 * It's nonetheless possible to use XXH3 for ephemeral data (local sessions),
 * but avoid storing values in long-term storage for later reads.
 *
 * The API supports one-shot hashing, streaming mode, and custom secrets.
 *
 * There are still a number of opened questions that community can influence during the experimental period.
 * I'm trying to list a few of them below, though don't consider this list as complete.
 *
 * - 128-bits output type : currently defined as a structure of two 64-bits fields.
 *                          That's because 128-bit values do not exist in C standard.
 *                          Note that it means that, at byte level, result is not identical depending on endianess.
 *                          However, at field level, they are identical on all platforms.
 *                          The canonical representation solves the issue of identical byte-level representation across platforms,
 *                          which is necessary for serialization.
 *                          Q1 : Would there be a better representation for a 128-bit hash result ?
 *                          Q2 : Are the names of the inner 64-bit fields important ? Should they be changed ?
 *
 * - Prototype XXH128() :   XXH128() uses the same arguments as XXH64(), for consistency.
 *                          It means it maps to XXH3p_128bits_withSeed().
 *                          This variant is slightly slower than XXH3p_128bits(),
 *                          because the seed is now part of the algorithm, and can't be simplified.
 *                          Is that a good idea ?
 *
 * - Seed type for XXH128() : currently, it's a single 64-bit value, like the 64-bit variant.
 *                          It could be argued that it's more logical to offer a 128-bit seed input parameter for a 128-bit hash.
 *                          But 128-bit seed is more difficult to use, since it requires to pass a structure instead of a scalar value.
 *                          Such a variant could either replace current one, or become an additional one.
 *                          Farmhash, for example, offers both variants (the 128-bits seed variant is called `doubleSeed`).
 *                          Follow up question : if both 64-bit and 128-bit seeds are allowed, which variant should be called XXH128 ?
 *
 * - Result for len==0 :    Currently, the result of hashing a zero-length input is always `0`.
 *                          It seems okay as a return value when using "default" secret and seed.
 *                          But is it still fine to return `0` when secret or seed are non-default ?
 *                          Are there use cases which could depend on generating a different hash result for zero-length input when the secret is different ?
 *
 * - Consistency (1) :      Streaming XXH128 uses an XXH3 state, which is the same state as XXH3p_64bits().
 *                          It means a 128bit streaming loop must invoke the following symbols :
 *                          XXH3p_createState(), XXH3p_128bits_reset(), XXH3p_128bits_update() (loop), XXH3p_128bits_digest(), XXH3p_freeState().
 *                          Is that consistent enough ?
 *
 * - Consistency (2) :      The canonical representation of `XXH3p_64bits` is provided by existing functions
 *                          XXH64_canonicalFromHash(), and reverse operation XXH64_hashFromCanonical().
 *                          As a mirror, canonical functions for XXH128_hash_t results generated by `XXH3p_128bits`
 *                          are XXH128_canonicalFromHash() and XXH128_hashFromCanonical().
 *                          Which means, `XXH3` doesn't appear in the names, because canonical functions operate on a type,
 *                          independently of which algorithm was used to generate that type.
 *                          Is that consistent enough ?
