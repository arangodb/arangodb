README.netware

  Read the README file first.

  Curl has been successfully compiled with gcc / nlmconv on different flavours
  of Linux as well as with the official Metrowerks CodeWarrior compiler.
  While not being the main development target, a continuously growing share of
  curl users are NetWare-based, especially also consuming the lib from PHP.

  The unix-style man pages are tricky to read on windows, so therefore all
  those pages are also provided as web pages on the curl web site.

  The main curl.1 man page is also "built-in" in the command line tool. Use a
  command line similar to this in order to extract a separate text file:

        curl -M >manual.txt

  Read the INSTALL file for instructions on how to compile curl self.
