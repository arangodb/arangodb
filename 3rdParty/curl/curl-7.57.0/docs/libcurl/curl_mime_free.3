.TH curl_mime_free 3 "22 August 2017" "libcurl 7.56.0" "libcurl Manual"
.SH NAME
curl_mime_free - free a previously built mime structure
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <curl/curl.h>
.sp
.BI "void curl_mime_free(curl_mime *" mime);
.ad
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIcurl_mime_free(3)\fP is used to clean up data previously built/appended
with \fIcurl_mime_addpart(3)\fP and other mime-handling functions.  This must
be called when the data has been used, which typically means after
\fIcurl_easy_perform(3)\fP has been called.

The handle to free is the one you passed to
the \fICURLOPT_MIMEPOST(3)\fP option: attached subparts mime structures must
not be explicitly freed as they are by the top structure freeing.

\fBmime\fP is the handle as returned from a previous call to
\fIcurl_mime_init(3)\fP and may be NULL.

.SH AVAILABILITY
As long as at least one of HTTP, SMTP or IMAP is enabled. Added in 7.56.0.
.SH RETURN VALUE
None
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR curl_mime_init "(3)"
