.TH CURLOPT_PROXY_SSLCERT 3 "16 Nov 2016" "libcurl 7.52.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"
.SH NAME
CURLOPT_PROXY_SSLCERT \- set SSL proxy client certificate
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_PROXY_SSLCERT, char *cert);
.SH DESCRIPTION
This option is for connecting to a HTTPS proxy, not a HTTPS server.

Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as parameter. The string should be
the file name of your client certificate used to connect to the HTTPS proxy.
The default format is "P12" on Secure Transport and "PEM" on other engines,
and can be changed with \fICURLOPT_PROXY_SSLCERTTYPE(3)\fP.

With NSS or Secure Transport, this can also be the nickname of the certificate
you wish to authenticate with as it is named in the security database. If you
want to use a file from the current directory, please precede it with "./"
prefix, in order to avoid confusion with a nickname.

When using a client certificate, you most likely also need to provide a
private key with \fICURLOPT_PROXY_SSLKEY(3)\fP.

The application does not have to keep the string around after setting this
option.
.SH DEFAULT
NULL
