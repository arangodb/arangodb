.TH CURLOPT_TCP_NODELAY 3 "30 Jun 2016" "libcurl 7.50.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"
.SH NAME
CURLOPT_TCP_NODELAY \- set the TCP_NODELAY option
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_TCP_NODELAY, long nodelay);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a long specifying whether the TCP_NODELAY option is to be set or cleared
(1L = set, 0 = clear). The option is set by default. This will have no effect
after the connection has been established.

Setting this option to 1L will disable TCP's Nagle algorithm on this
connection. The purpose of this algorithm is to try to minimize the number of
small packets on the network (where "small packets" means TCP segments less
than the Maximum Segment Size (MSS) for the network).

Maximizing the amount of data sent per TCP segment is good because it
amortizes the overhead of the send. However, in some cases small segments may
need to be sent without delay. This is less efficient than sending larger
amounts of data at a time, and can contribute to congestion on the network if
overdone.
.SH DEFAULT
1
.SH PROTOCOLS
All
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
if(curl) {
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "http://example.com");
  /* disable Nagle */
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_TCP_FASTOPEN, 0);
  curl_easy_perform(curl);
}
.fi
.SH AVAILABILITY
Always. The default was changed to 1 from 0 in 7.50.2.

Returns CURLE_OK
