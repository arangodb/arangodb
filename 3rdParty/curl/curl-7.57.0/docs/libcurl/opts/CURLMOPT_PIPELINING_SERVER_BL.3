.TH CURLMOPT_PIPELINING_SERVER_BL 3 "4 Nov 2014" "libcurl 7.39.0" "curl_multi_setopt options"
.SH NAME
CURLMOPT_PIPELINING_SERVER_BL \- pipelining server blacklist
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLMcode curl_multi_setopt(CURLM *handle, CURLMOPT_PIPELINING_SERVER_BL, char **servers);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a \fBservers\fP array of char *, ending with a NULL entry. This is a list
of server types prefixes (in the Server: HTTP header) that are blacklisted
from pipelining, i.e server types that are known to not support HTTP
pipelining. The array is copied by libcurl.

Note that the comparison matches if the Server: header begins with the string
in the blacklist, i.e "Server: Ninja 1.2.3" and "Server: Ninja 1.4.0" can 
both be blacklisted by having "Ninja" in the backlist.

Pass a NULL pointer to clear the blacklist.
.SH DEFAULT
The default value is NULL, which means that there is no blacklist.
