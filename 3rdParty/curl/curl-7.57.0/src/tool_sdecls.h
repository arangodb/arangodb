 * OutStruct variables keep track of information relative to curl's
 * output writing, which may take place to a standard stream or a file.
 *
 * 'filename' member is either a pointer to a file name string or NULL
 * when dealing with a standard stream.
 *
 * 'alloc_filename' member is TRUE when string pointed by 'filename' has been
 * dynamically allocated and 'belongs' to this OutStruct, otherwise FALSE.
 *
 * 'is_cd_filename' member is TRUE when string pointed by 'filename' has been
 * set using a server-specified Content-Disposition filename, otherwise FALSE.
 *
 * 's_isreg' member is TRUE when output goes to a regular file, this also
 * implies that output is 'seekable' and 'appendable' and also that member
 * 'filename' points to file name's string. For any standard stream member
 * 's_isreg' will be FALSE.
 *
 * 'fopened' member is TRUE when output goes to a regular file and it
 * has been fopen'ed, requiring it to be closed later on. In any other
 * case this is FALSE.
 *
 * 'stream' member is a pointer to a stream controlling object as returned
 * from a 'fopen' call or a standard stream.
 *
 * 'config' member is a pointer to associated 'OperationConfig' struct.
 *
 * 'bytes' member represents amount written so far.
 *
 * 'init' member holds original file size or offset at which truncation is
 * taking place. Always zero unless appending to a non-empty regular file.
 *
 * 'metalink_parser' member is a pointer to Metalink XML parser
 * context.
