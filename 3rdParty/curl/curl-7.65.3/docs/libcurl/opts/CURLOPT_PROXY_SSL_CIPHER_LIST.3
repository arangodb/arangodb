.TH CURLOPT_PROXY_SSL_CIPHER_LIST 3 "16 Nov 2016" "libcurl 7.52.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"
.SH NAME
CURLOPT_PROXY_SSL_CIPHER_LIST \- specify ciphers to use for proxy TLS
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_PROXY_SSL_CIPHER_LIST, char *list);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a char *, pointing to a zero terminated string holding the list of
ciphers to use for the connection to the HTTPS proxy. The list must be
syntactically correct, it consists of one or more cipher strings separated by
colons. Commas or spaces are also acceptable separators but colons are
normally used, \&!, \&- and \&+ can be used as operators.

For OpenSSL and GnuTLS valid examples of cipher lists include 'RC4-SHA',
\'SHA1+DES\', 'TLSv1' and 'DEFAULT'. The default list is normally set when you
compile OpenSSL.

You'll find more details about cipher lists on this URL:

 https://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html

For NSS, valid examples of cipher lists include 'rsa_rc4_128_md5',
\'rsa_aes_128_sha\', etc. With NSS you don't add/remove ciphers. If one uses
this option then all known ciphers are disabled and only those passed in are
enabled.

You'll find more details about the NSS cipher lists on this URL:

 http://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/mod_nss.git/plain/docs/mod_nss.html#Directives

The application does not have to keep the string around after setting this
option.
.SH DEFAULT
NULL, use internal default
.SH PROTOCOLS
All
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
if(curl) {
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com/");
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_PROXY, "https://localhost");
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_PROXY_SSL_CIPHER_LIST, "TLSv1");
  ret = curl_easy_perform(curl);
  curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
}
.fi
.SH AVAILABILITY
Added in 7.52.0

If built TLS enabled.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns CURLE_OK if TLS is supported, CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not, or
CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY if there was insufficient heap space.
