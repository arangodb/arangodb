.TH CURLOPT_RTSP_TRANSPORT 3 "19 Jun 2014" "libcurl 7.37.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"
.SH NAME
CURLOPT_RTSP_TRANSPORT \- set RTSP Transport: header
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_RTSP_TRANSPORT,
                          char *transport);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a char * to tell libcurl what to pass for the Transport: header for this
RTSP session. This is mainly a convenience method to avoid needing to set a
custom Transport: header for every SETUP request. The application must set a
Transport: header before issuing a SETUP request.

The application does not have to keep the string around after setting this
option.
