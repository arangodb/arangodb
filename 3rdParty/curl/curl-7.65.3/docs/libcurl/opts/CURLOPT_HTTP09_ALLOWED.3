.SH NAME
CURLOPT_HTTP09 \- allow HTTP/0.9 response
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_HTTP09_ALLOWED, long allowed);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass the long argument \fIallowed\fP set to 1L to allow HTTP/0.9 responses.

A HTTP/0.9 response is a server response entirely without headers and only a
body, while you can connect to lots of random TCP services and still get a
response that curl might consider to be HTTP/0.9.
.SH DEFAULT
curl allows HTTP/0.9 responses by default.

A future curl version will require this option to be set to allow HTTP/0.9
responses.

HTTP

CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
if(curl) {
  CURLcode ret;
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com/");
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_HTTP09_ALLOWED, 1L);
  ret = curl_easy_perform(curl);
}
.fi
.SH AVAILABILITY
