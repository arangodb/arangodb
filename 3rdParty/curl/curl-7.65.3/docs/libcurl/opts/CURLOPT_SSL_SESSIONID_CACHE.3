.TH CURLOPT_SSL_SESSIONID_CACHE 3 "19 Jun 2014" "libcurl 7.37.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"
.SH NAME
CURLOPT_SSL_SESSIONID_CACHE \- enable/disable use of the SSL session-ID cache
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_SSL_SESSIONID_CACHE,
                         long enabled);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a long set to 0 to disable libcurl's use of SSL session-ID caching. Set
this to 1 to enable it. By default all transfers are done using the cache
enabled. While nothing ever should get hurt by attempting to reuse SSL
session-IDs, there seem to be or have been broken SSL implementations in the
wild that may require you to disable this in order for you to succeed.
.SH DEFAULT
1
.SH PROTOCOLS
All TLS-based
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
if(curl) {
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com/");
  /* switch off session-id use! */
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_SSL_SESSIONID_CACHE, 0L);
  ret = curl_easy_perform(curl);
  curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
}
