.TH CURLMOPT_MAX_HOST_CONNECTIONS 3 "17 Jun 2014" "libcurl 7.37.0" "curl_multi_setopt options"
.SH NAME
CURLMOPT_MAX_HOST_CONNECTIONS \- set max number of connections to a single host
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLMcode curl_multi_setopt(CURLM *handle, CURLMOPT_MAX_HOST_CONNECTIONS, long max);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a long to indicate \fBmax\fP. The set number will be used as the maximum
amount of simultaneously open connections to a single host (a host being the
same as a host name + port number pair). For each new session to a host,
libcurl will open a new connection up to the limit set by
\fICURLMOPT_MAX_HOST_CONNECTIONS(3)\fP. When the limit is reached, the
sessions will be pending until a connection becomes available. If
\fICURLMOPT_PIPELINING(3)\fP is enabled, libcurl will try to pipeline if the
host is capable of it.

The default \fBmax\fP value is 0, unlimited.  However, for backwards
compatibility, setting it to 0 when \fICURLMOPT_PIPELINING(3)\fP is 1 will not
be treated as unlimited. Instead it will open only 1 connection and try to
pipeline on it.

This set limit is also used for proxy connections, and then the proxy is
considered to be the host for which this limit counts.
.SH DEFAULT
0
.SH PROTOCOLS
HTTP(S)
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
CURLM *m = curl_multi_init();
/* do no more than 2 connections per host */
curl_multi_setopt(m, CURLMOPT_MAX_HOST_CONNECTIONS, 2L);
.fi
.SH AVAILABILITY
Added in 7.30.0
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns CURLM_OK if the option is supported, and CURLM_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not.
