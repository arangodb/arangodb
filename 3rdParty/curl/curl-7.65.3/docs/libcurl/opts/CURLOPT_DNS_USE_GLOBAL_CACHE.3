.TH CURLOPT_DNS_USE_GLOBAL_CACHE 3 "17 Jun 2014" "libcurl 7.37.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"
.SH NAME
CURLOPT_DNS_USE_GLOBAL_CACHE \- enable/disable global DNS cache
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_DNS_USE_GLOBAL_CACHE,
                          long enable);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Has no function since 7.62.0. Do note use!

Pass a long. If the \fIenable\fP value is 1, it tells curl to use a global DNS
cache that will survive between easy handle creations and deletions. This is
not thread-safe and this will use a global variable.

\fBWARNING:\fP this option is considered obsolete. Stop using it. Switch over
to using the share interface instead! See \fICURLOPT_SHARE(3)\fP and
\fIcurl_share_init(3)\fP.

  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_DNS_USE_GLOBAL_CACHE, 0L);
