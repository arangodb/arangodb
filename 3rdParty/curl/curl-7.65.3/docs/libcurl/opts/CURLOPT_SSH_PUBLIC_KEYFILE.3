.TH CURLOPT_SSH_PUBLIC_KEYFILE 3 "19 Jun 2014" "libcurl 7.37.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"
.SH NAME
CURLOPT_SSH_PUBLIC_KEYFILE \- set public key file for SSH auth
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_SSH_PUBLIC_KEYFILE,
                          char *filename);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a char * pointing to a \fIfilename\fP for your public key. If not used,
libcurl defaults to \fB$HOME/.ssh/id_dsa.pub\fP if the HOME environment
variable is set, and just "id_dsa.pub" in the current directory if HOME is not
set.

If NULL (or an empty string) is passed, libcurl will pass no public key to
libssh2, which then tries to compute it from the private key.  This is known
to work with libssh2 1.4.0+ linked against OpenSSL.

The application does not have to keep the string around after setting this
option.
.SH DEFAULT
NULL
.SH PROTOCOLS
SFTP and SCP
