.TH CURLINFO_SSL_ENGINES 3 "1 Sep 2015" "libcurl 7.44.0" "curl_easy_getinfo options"
.SH NAME
CURLINFO_SSL_ENGINES \- get an slist of OpenSSL crypto-engines
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_getinfo(CURL *handle, CURLINFO_SSL_ENGINES,
                           struct curl_slist **engine_list);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass the address of a 'struct curl_slist *' to receive a linked-list of
OpenSSL crypto-engines supported. Note that engines are normally implemented
in separate dynamic libraries. Hence not all the returned engines may be
available at run-time. \fBNOTE:\fP you must call \fIcurl_slist_free_all(3)\fP
on the list pointer once you're done with it, as libcurl will not free the
data for you.
.SH PROTOCOLS
All TLS based ones.
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
if(curl) {
  CURLcode res;
  struct curl_slist *engines;
  res = curl_easy_getinfo(curl, CURLINFO_SSL_ENGINES, &engines);
  if((res == CURLE_OK) && engines) {
    /* we have a list, free it when done using it */
    curl_slist_free_all(engines);
  }

  curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
}
.fi
.SH AVAILABILITY
Added in 7.12.3. Available in OpenSSL builds with "engine" support.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns CURLE_OK if the option is supported, and CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR curl_easy_getinfo "(3), " curl_easy_setopt "(3), "
