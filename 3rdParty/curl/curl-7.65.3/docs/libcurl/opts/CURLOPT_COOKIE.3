.TH CURLOPT_COOKIE 3 "17 Jun 2014" "libcurl 7.37.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"
.SH NAME
CURLOPT_COOKIE \- set contents of HTTP Cookie header
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_COOKIE, char *cookie);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as parameter. It will be used to
set a cookie in the HTTP request. The format of the string should be
NAME=CONTENTS, where NAME is the cookie name and CONTENTS is what the cookie
should contain.

If you need to set multiple cookies, set them all using a single option
concatenated like this: "name1=content1; name2=content2;" etc.

This option sets the cookie header explicitly in the outgoing request(s). If
multiple requests are done due to authentication, followed redirections or
similar, they will all get this cookie passed on.

The cookies set by this option are separate from the internal cookie storage
held by the cookie engine and will not be modified by it. If you enable the
cookie engine and either you've imported a cookie of the same name (e.g. 'foo')
or the server has set one, it will have no effect on the cookies you set here.
A request to the server will send both the 'foo' held by the cookie engine and
the 'foo' held by this option. To set a cookie that is instead held by the
cookie engine and can be modified by the server use
\fICURLOPT_COOKIELIST(3)\fP.

Using this option multiple times will only make the latest string override the
previous ones.

This option will not enable the cookie engine. Use \fICURLOPT_COOKIEFILE(3)\fP
or \fICURLOPT_COOKIEJAR(3)\fP to enable parsing and sending cookies
automatically.

The application does not have to keep the string around after setting this
option.
