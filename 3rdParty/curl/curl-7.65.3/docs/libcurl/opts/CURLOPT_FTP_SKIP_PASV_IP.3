.TH CURLOPT_FTP_SKIP_PASV_IP 3 "19 Jun 2014" "libcurl 7.37.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"
.SH NAME
CURLOPT_FTP_SKIP_PASV_IP \- ignore the IP address in the PASV response
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_FTP_SKIP_PASV_IP, long skip);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a long. If \fIskip\fP is set to 1, it instructs libcurl to not use the IP
address the server suggests in its 227-response to libcurl's PASV command when
libcurl connects the data connection. Instead libcurl will re-use the same IP
address it already uses for the control connection. But it will use the port
number from the 227-response.

This option thus allows libcurl to work around broken server installations
that due to NATs, firewalls or incompetence report the wrong IP address back.

This option has no effect if PORT, EPRT or EPSV is used instead of PASV.

0
