.TH CURLOPT_TIMEVALUE_LARGE 3 "25 Jan 2018" "libcurl 7.59.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"
.SH NAME
CURLOPT_TIMEVALUE_LARGE \- set time value for conditional
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_TIMEVALUE_LARGE, curl_off_t val);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a curl_off_t \fIval\fP as parameter. This should be the time counted as
seconds since 1 Jan 1970, and the time will be used in a condition as
specified with \fICURLOPT_TIMECONDITION(3)\fP.

The difference between this option and \fICURLOPT_TIMEVALUE(3)\fP is the type
of the argument. On systems where 'long' is only 32 bit wide, this option has
to be used to set dates beyond the year 2038.
