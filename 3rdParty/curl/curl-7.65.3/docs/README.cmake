  Read the README file first.

  Curl contains CMake build files that provide a way to build Curl with the
  CMake build tool (www.cmake.org). CMake is a cross platform meta build tool
  that generates native makefiles and IDE project files. The CMake build
  system can be used to build Curl on any of its supported platforms.

  Read the INSTALL.cmake file for instructions on how to compile curl with
  CMake.
