GIT-INFO

This file is only present in git - never in release archives. It contains
information about other files and things that the git repository keeps in its
inner sanctum.

To build in environments that support configure, after having extracted
everything from git, do this:

./buildconf
./configure
make

  Daniel uses a ./configure line similar to this for easier development:

  ./configure --disable-shared --enable-debug --enable-maintainer-mode

In environments that don't support configure (i.e. Microsoft), do this:

buildconf.bat


REQUIREMENTS

 For buildconf (not buildconf.bat) to work, you need the following software
installed:

 o autoconf 2.57  (or later)
 o automake 1.7   (or later)
 o libtool  1.4.2 (or later)
 o GNU m4 (required by autoconf)

 o nroff + perl

   If you don't have nroff and perl and you for some reason don't want to
   install them, you can rename the source file src/tool_hugehelp.c.cvs to
   src/tool_hugehelp.c and avoid having to generate this file. This will
   give you a stubbed version of the file that doesn't contain actual content.
