.TH curl_mime_filename 3 "September 22, 2017" "libcurl 7.63.0" "libcurl Manual"

.SH NAME
curl_mime_filename - set a mime part's remote file name
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <curl/curl.h>
.sp
.BI "CURLcode curl_mime_filename(curl_mimepart * " part ,
.BI "const char * " filename ");"
.ad
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIcurl_mime_filename(3)\fP sets a mime part's remote file name. When remote
file name is set, content data is processed as a file, whatever is the part's
content source. A part's remote file name is transmitted to the server in the
associated Content-Disposition generated header.

\fIpart\fP is the part's handle to assign the remote file name to.

\fIfilename\fP points to the nul-terminated file name string; it may be set to
NULL to remove a previously attached remote file name.

The remote file name string is copied into the part, thus the associated
storage may safely be released or reused after call. Setting a part's file
name twice is valid: only the value set by the last call is retained.
.SH AVAILABILITY
As long as at least one of HTTP, SMTP or IMAP is enabled. Added in 7.56.0.
.SH RETURN VALUE
CURLE_OK or a CURL error code upon failure.
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
 curl_mime *mime;
 curl_mimepart *part;

 /* create a mime handle */
 mime = curl_mime_init(easy);

 /* add a part */
 part = curl_mime_addpart(mime);

 /* send image data from memory */
 curl_mime_data(part, imagebuf, imagebuf_len);

 /* set a file name to make it look like a file upload */
 curl_mime_filename(part, "image.png");

 /* set name */
 curl_mime_name(part, "data");
