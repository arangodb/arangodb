.TH curl_mime_name 3 "September 22, 2017" "libcurl 7.63.0" "libcurl Manual"

.SH NAME
curl_mime_name - set a mime part's name
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <curl/curl.h>
.sp
.BI "CURLcode curl_mime_name(curl_mimepart * " part ", const char * " name ");"
.ad
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIcurl_mime_name(3)\fP sets a mime part's name. This is the way HTTP form
fields are named.

\fIpart\fP is the part's handle to assign a name to.

\fIname\fP points to the zero-terminated name string.

The name string is copied into the part, thus the associated storage may
safely be released or reused after call. Setting a part's name twice is valid:
only the value set by the last call is retained. It is possible to "unname" a
part by setting \fIname\fP to NULL.
.SH AVAILABILITY
As long as at least one of HTTP, SMTP or IMAP is enabled. Added in 7.56.0.
.SH RETURN VALUE
CURLE_OK or a CURL error code upon failure.
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
 curl_mime *mime;
 curl_mimepart *part;

 /* create a mime handle */
 mime = curl_mime_init(easy);

 /* add a part */
 part = curl_mime_addpart(mime);

 /* give the part a name */
 curl_mime_name(part, "shoe_size");
.fi
