.TH CURLOPT_HTTP_VERSION 3 "September 05, 2018" "libcurl 7.63.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"

.SH NAME
CURLOPT_HTTP_VERSION \- specify HTTP protocol version to use
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_HTTP_VERSION, long version);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass \fIversion\fP a long, set to one of the values described below. They ask
libcurl to use the specific HTTP versions. This is not sensible to do unless
you have a good reason. You have to set this option if you want to use
libcurl's HTTP/2 support.

Note that the HTTP version is just a request. libcurl will still prioritize to
re-use an existing connection so it might then re-use a connection using a
HTTP version you haven't asked for.

.IP CURL_HTTP_VERSION_NONE
We don't care about what version the library uses. libcurl will use whatever
it thinks fit.
.IP CURL_HTTP_VERSION_1_0
Enforce HTTP 1.0 requests.
.IP CURL_HTTP_VERSION_1_1
Enforce HTTP 1.1 requests.
.IP CURL_HTTP_VERSION_2_0
Attempt HTTP 2 requests. libcurl will fall back to HTTP 1.1 if HTTP 2 can't be
negotiated with the server. (Added in 7.33.0)

The alias \fICURL_HTTP_VERSION_2\fP was added in 7.43.0 to better reflect the
actual protocol name.
.IP CURL_HTTP_VERSION_2TLS
Attempt HTTP 2 over TLS (HTTPS) only. libcurl will fall back to HTTP 1.1 if
HTTP 2 can't be negotiated with the HTTPS server. For clear text HTTP servers,
libcurl will use 1.1. (Added in 7.47.0)
.IP CURL_HTTP_VERSION_2_PRIOR_KNOWLEDGE
Issue non-TLS HTTP requests using HTTP/2 without HTTP/1.1 Upgrade. It requires
prior knowledge that the server supports HTTP/2 straight away. HTTPS requests
will still do HTTP/2 the standard way with negotiated protocol version in the
TLS handshake. (Added in 7.49.0)
.SH DEFAULT
Since curl 7.62.0: CURL_HTTP_VERSION_2TLS

Before that: CURL_HTTP_VERSION_1_1
.SH PROTOCOLS
HTTP
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
if(curl) {
  CURLcode ret;
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com/");
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_HTTP_VERSION, CURL_HTTP_VERSION_2TLS);
  ret = curl_easy_perform(curl);
  if(ret == CURLE_HTTP_RETURNED_ERROR) {
    /* an HTTP response error problem */
  }
}
.fi
.SH AVAILABILITY
Along with HTTP
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns CURLE_OK if HTTP is supported, and CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not.
