.TH CURLOPT_NOPROXY 3 "August 24, 2018" "libcurl 7.63.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"

.SH NAME
CURLOPT_NOPROXY \- disable proxy use for specific hosts
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_NOPROXY, char *noproxy);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string. The string consists of a comma
separated list of host names that do not require a proxy to get reached, even
if one is specified.  The only wildcard available is a single * character,
which matches all hosts, and effectively disables the proxy. Each name in this
list is matched as either a domain which contains the hostname, or the
hostname itself. For example, example.com would match example.com,
example.com:80, and www.example.com, but not www.notanexample.com or
example.com.othertld.

If the name in the noproxy list has a leading period, it is a domain match
against the provided host name. This way ".example.com" will switch off proxy
use for both "www.example.com" as well as for "foo.example.com".

Setting the noproxy string to "" (an empty string) will explicitly enable the
proxy for all host names, even if there is an environment variable set for it.

Enter IPv6 numerical addresses in the list of host names without enclosing
brackets:

 "example.com,::1,localhost"

The application does not have to keep the string around after setting this
option.
.SH "Environment variables"
If there's an environment variable called \fBno_proxy\fP (or \fBNO_PROXY\fP),
it will be used if the \fICURLOPT_NOPROXY(3)\fP option is not set. It works
exactly the same way.
.SH DEFAULT
NULL
