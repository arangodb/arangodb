.TH CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS 3 "February 03, 2016" "libcurl 7.63.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"

.SH NAME
CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS \- have libcurl copy data to POST
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS, char *data);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a char * as parameter, which should be the full \fIdata\fP to post in a
HTTP POST operation. It behaves as the \fICURLOPT_POSTFIELDS(3)\fP option, but
the original data is instead copied by the library, allowing the application
to overwrite the original data after setting this option.

Because data are copied, care must be taken when using this option in
conjunction with \fICURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE(3)\fP or
\fICURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE_LARGE(3)\fP: If the size has not been set prior to
\fICURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS(3)\fP, the data is assumed to be a zero terminated
string; else the stored size informs the library about the byte count to
copy. In any case, the size must not be changed after
\fICURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS(3)\fP, unless another \fICURLOPT_POSTFIELDS(3)\fP or
\fICURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS(3)\fP option is issued.
.SH DEFAULT
NULL
