.TH CURLOPT_SSH_KNOWNHOSTS 3 "May 31, 2017" "libcurl 7.63.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"

.SH NAME
CURLOPT_SSH_KNOWNHOSTS \- file name holding the SSH known hosts
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_SSH_KNOWNHOSTS, char *fname);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string holding the file name of the
known_host file to use.  The known_hosts file should use the OpenSSH file
format as supported by libssh2. If this file is specified, libcurl will only
accept connections with hosts that are known and present in that file, with a
matching public key. Use \fICURLOPT_SSH_KEYFUNCTION(3)\fP to alter the default
behavior on host and key (mis)matching.

The application does not have to keep the string around after setting this
option.
