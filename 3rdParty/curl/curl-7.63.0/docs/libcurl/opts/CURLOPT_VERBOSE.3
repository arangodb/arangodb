.TH CURLOPT_VERBOSE 3 "February 03, 2016" "libcurl 7.63.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"

.SH NAME
CURLOPT_VERBOSE \- set verbose mode on/off
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_VERBOSE, long onoff);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Set the \fIonoff\fP parameter to 1 to make the library display a lot of
verbose information about its operations on this \fIhandle\fP. Very useful for
libcurl and/or protocol debugging and understanding. The verbose information
will be sent to stderr, or the stream set with \fICURLOPT_STDERR(3)\fP.

You hardly ever want this set in production use, you will almost always want
this when you debug/report problems.

To also get all the protocol data sent and received, consider using the
\fICURLOPT_DEBUGFUNCTION(3)\fP.
.SH DEFAULT
0, meaning disabled.
.SH PROTOCOLS
All
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
if(curl) {
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "http://example.com");

  /* ask libcurl to show us the verbose output */
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_VERBOSE, 1L);

  /* Perform the request */
  curl_easy_perform(curl);
}
.fi
