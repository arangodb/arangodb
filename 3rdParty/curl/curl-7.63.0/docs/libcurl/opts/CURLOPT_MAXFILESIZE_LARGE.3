.TH CURLOPT_MAXFILESIZE_LARGE 3 "May 30, 2017" "libcurl 7.63.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"

.SH NAME
CURLOPT_MAXFILESIZE_LARGE \- maximum file size allowed to download
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_MAXFILESIZE_LARGE,
                          curl_off_t size);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a curl_off_t as parameter. This allows you to specify the maximum
\fIsize\fP (in bytes) of a file to download. If the file requested is found
larger than this value, the transfer will not start and
\fICURLE_FILESIZE_EXCEEDED\fP will be returned.

The file size is not always known prior to download, and for such files this
option has no effect even if the file transfer ends up being larger than this
given limit. This concerns both FTP and HTTP transfers.
.SH DEFAULT
None
.SH PROTOCOLS
FTP and HTTP
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
if(curl) {
  CURLcode ret;
  curl_off_t ridiculous = 1 << 48;
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com/");
  /* refuse to download if larger than ridiculous */
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_MAXFILESIZE_LARGE, ridiculous);
  ret = curl_easy_perform(curl);
}
.fi
.SH AVAILABILITY
