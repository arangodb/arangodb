.TH CURLOPT_USERPWD 3 "August 24, 2017" "libcurl 7.63.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"

.SH NAME
CURLOPT_USERPWD \- user name and password to use in authentication
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_USERPWD, char *userpwd);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a char * as parameter, pointing to a zero terminated login details string
for the connection. The format of which is: [user name]:[password].

When using Kerberos V5 authentication with a Windows based server, you should
specify the user name part with the domain name in order for the server to
successfully obtain a Kerberos Ticket. If you don't then the initial part of
the authentication handshake may fail.

When using NTLM, the user name can be specified simply as the user name
without the domain name should the server be part of a single domain and
forest.

To specify the domain name use either Down-Level Logon Name or UPN (User
Principal Name) formats. For example, EXAMPLE\\user and user@example.com
respectively.

Some HTTP servers (on Windows) support inclusion of the domain for Basic
authentication as well.

When using HTTP and \fICURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION(3)\fP, libcurl might perform
several requests to possibly different hosts. libcurl will only send this user
and password information to hosts using the initial host name (unless
\fICURLOPT_UNRESTRICTED_AUTH(3)\fP is set), so if libcurl follows locations to
other hosts it will not send the user and password to those. This is enforced
to prevent accidental information leakage.

Use \fICURLOPT_HTTPAUTH(3)\fP to specify the authentication method for HTTP
based connections or \fICURLOPT_LOGIN_OPTIONS(3)\fP to control IMAP, POP3 and
SMTP options.

The user and password strings are not URL decoded, so there's no way to send
in a user name containing a colon using this option. Use
\fICURLOPT_USERNAME(3)\fP for that, or include it in the URL.

The application does not have to keep the string around after setting this
option.
