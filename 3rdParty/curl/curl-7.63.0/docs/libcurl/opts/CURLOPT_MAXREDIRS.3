.TH CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS 3 "February 03, 2016" "libcurl 7.63.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"

.SH NAME
CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS \- maximum number of redirects allowed
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS, long amount);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a long. The set number will be the redirection limit \fIamount\fP. If
that many redirections have been followed, the next redirect will cause an
error (\fICURLE_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS\fP). This option only makes sense if the
\fICURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION(3)\fP is used at the same time.

Setting the limit to 0 will make libcurl refuse any redirect.

Set it to -1 for an infinite number of redirects.
.SH DEFAULT
-1, unlimited

curl = curl_easy_init();
if(curl) {
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "http://example.com/");

  /* enable redirect following */
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, 1L);

  /* allow three redirects */
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS, 3L);

  /* Perform the request */
  curl_easy_perform(curl);
}
