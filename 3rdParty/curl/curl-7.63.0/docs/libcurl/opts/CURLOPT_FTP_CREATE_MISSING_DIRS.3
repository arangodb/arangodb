.TH CURLOPT_FTP_CREATE_MISSING_DIRS 3 "May 05, 2017" "libcurl 7.63.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"

.SH NAME
CURLOPT_FTP_CREATE_MISSING_DIRS \- create missing dirs for FTP and SFTP
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

typedef enum {
  CURLFTP_CREATE_DIR_NONE,
  CURLFTP_CREATE_DIR,
  CURLFTP_CREATE_DIR_RETRY
} curl_ftpcreatedir;

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_FTP_CREATE_MISSING_DIRS,
                          long create);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a long telling libcurl to \fIcreate\fP the dir. If the value is
\fICURLFTP_CREATE_DIR\fP (1), libcurl will attempt to create any remote
directory that it fails to "move" into.

For FTP requests, that means a CWD command fails. CWD being the command that
changes working directory.

For SFTP requests, libcurl will attempt to create the remote directory if it
can't obtain a handle to the target-location. The creation will fail if a file
of the same name as the directory to create already exists or lack of
permissions prevents creation.

Setting \fIcreate\fP to \fICURLFTP_CREATE_DIR_RETRY\fP (2), tells libcurl to
retry the CWD command again if the subsequent MKD command fails. This is
especially useful if you're doing many simultaneous connections against the
same server and they all have this option enabled, as then CWD may first fail
but then another connection does MKD before this connection and thus MKD fails
but trying CWD works!
.SH DEFAULT
CURLFTP_CREATE_DIR_NONE (0)
.SH PROTOCOLS
FTP and SFTP
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
if(curl) {
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "ftp://example.com/non-existing/new.txt");
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_FTP_CREATE_MISSING_DIRS,
                         CURLFTP_CREATE_DIR_RETRY);

  ret = curl_easy_perform(curl);

  curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
}
.fi
.SH AVAILABILITY
Added in 7.10.7. SFTP support added in 7.16.3. The retry option was added in
7.19.4.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns CURLE_OK if the option is supported, and CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if the
create value is not.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR CURLOPT_FTP_FILEMETHOD "(3), " CURLOPT_FTP_USE_EPSV "(3), "
