.TH CURLMOPT_MAX_PIPELINE_LENGTH 3 "May 27, 2017" "libcurl 7.63.0" "curl_multi_setopt options"

.SH NAME
CURLMOPT_MAX_PIPELINE_LENGTH \- maximum number of requests in a pipeline
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLMcode curl_multi_setopt(CURLM *handle, CURLMOPT_MAX_PIPELINE_LENGTH, long max);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a long. The set \fBmax\fP number will be used as the maximum amount of
outstanding requests in an HTTP/1.1 pipelined connection. This option is only
used for HTTP/1.1 pipelining, not for HTTP/2 multiplexing.

When this limit is reached, libcurl will use another connection to the same
host (see \fICURLMOPT_MAX_HOST_CONNECTIONS(3)\fP), or queue the request until
one of the pipelines to the host is ready to accept a request.  Thus, the
total number of requests in-flight is \fICURLMOPT_MAX_HOST_CONNECTIONS(3)\fP *
\fICURLMOPT_MAX_PIPELINE_LENGTH(3)\fP.
.SH DEFAULT
5
