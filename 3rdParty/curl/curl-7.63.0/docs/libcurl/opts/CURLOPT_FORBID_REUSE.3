.TH CURLOPT_FORBID_REUSE 3 "May 31, 2017" "libcurl 7.63.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"

.SH NAME
CURLOPT_FORBID_REUSE \- make connection get closed at once after use
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_FORBID_REUSE, long close);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a long. Set \fIclose\fP to 1 to make libcurl explicitly close the
connection when done with the transfer. Normally, libcurl keeps all
connections alive when done with one transfer in case a succeeding one follows
that can re-use them.  This option should be used with caution and only if you
understand what it does as it can seriously impact performance.

Set to 0 to have libcurl keep the connection open for possible later re-use
(default behavior).
