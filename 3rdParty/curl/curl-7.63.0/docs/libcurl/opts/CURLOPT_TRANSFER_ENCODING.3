.TH CURLOPT_TRANSFER_ENCODING 3 "May 15, 2017" "libcurl 7.63.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"

.SH NAME
CURLOPT_TRANSFER_ENCODING \- ask for HTTP Transfer Encoding
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_TRANSFER_ENCODING, long enable);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a long set to 1L to \fIenable\fP or 0 to disable.

Adds a request for compressed Transfer Encoding in the outgoing HTTP
request. If the server supports this and so desires, it can respond with the
HTTP response sent using a compressed Transfer-Encoding that will be
automatically uncompressed by libcurl on reception.

Transfer-Encoding differs slightly from the Content-Encoding you ask for with
\fICURLOPT_ACCEPT_ENCODING(3)\fP in that a Transfer-Encoding is strictly meant
to be for the transfer and thus MUST be decoded before the data arrives in the
client. Traditionally, Transfer-Encoding has been much less used and supported
by both HTTP clients and HTTP servers.
