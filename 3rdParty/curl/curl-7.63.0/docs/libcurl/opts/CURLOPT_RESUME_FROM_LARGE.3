.TH CURLOPT_RESUME_FROM_LARGE 3 "February 03, 2016" "libcurl 7.63.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"

.SH NAME
CURLOPT_RESUME_FROM_LARGE \- set a point to resume transfer from
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_RESUME_FROM_LARGE,
                          curl_off_t from);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a curl_off_t as parameter. It contains the offset in number of bytes that
you want the transfer to start from. Set this option to 0 to make the transfer
start from the beginning (effectively disabling resume). For FTP, set this
option to -1 to make the transfer start from the end of the target file
(useful to continue an interrupted upload).

When doing uploads with FTP, the resume position is where in the local/source
file libcurl should try to resume the upload from and it will then append the
source file to the remote target file.
.SH DEFAULT
0, not used
.SH PROTOCOLS
HTTP, FTP, SFTP, FILE
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
if(curl) {
  curl_off_t resume_position = GET_IT_SOMEHOW;
  curl_off_t file_size = GET_IT_SOMEHOW_AS_WELL;

  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "ftp://example.com");

  /* resuming upload at this position, possibly beyond 2GB */
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_RESUME_FROM_LARGE, resume_position);

  /* ask for upload */
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_UPLOAD, 1L);

  /* set total data amount to expect */
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_INFILESIZE_LARGE, file_size);

  /* Perform the request */
  curl_easy_perform(curl);
}
