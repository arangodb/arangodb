.TH CURLOPT_CONNECT_ONLY 3 "May 31, 2017" "libcurl 7.63.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"

.SH NAME
CURLOPT_CONNECT_ONLY \- stop when connected to target server
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_CONNECT_ONLY, long only);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a long. If the parameter equals 1, it tells the library to perform all
the required proxy authentication and connection setup, but no data transfer,
and then return.

The option can be used to simply test a connection to a server, but is more
useful when used with the \fICURLINFO_ACTIVESOCKET(3)\fP option to
\fIcurl_easy_getinfo(3)\fP as the library can set up the connection and then
the application can obtain the most recently used socket for special data
transfers.

0
