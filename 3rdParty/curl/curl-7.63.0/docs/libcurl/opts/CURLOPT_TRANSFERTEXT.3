.TH CURLOPT_TRANSFERTEXT 3 "May 31, 2017" "libcurl 7.63.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"

.SH NAME
CURLOPT_TRANSFERTEXT \- request a text based transfer for FTP
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_TRANSFERTEXT, long text);
.SH DESCRIPTION
A parameter set to 1 tells the library to use ASCII mode for FTP transfers,
instead of the default binary transfer. For win32 systems it does not set the
stdout to binary mode. This option can be usable when transferring text data
between systems with different views on certain characters, such as newlines
or similar.

libcurl does not do a complete ASCII conversion when doing ASCII transfers
over FTP. This is a known limitation/flaw that nobody has rectified. libcurl
simply sets the mode to ASCII and performs a standard transfer.
.SH DEFAULT
0, disabled
.SH PROTOCOLS
FTP
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
if(curl) {
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "ftp://example.com/textfile");

  ret = curl_easy_perform(curl);
  curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
}
.fi
