.TH CURLOPT_SSH_PRIVATE_KEYFILE 3 "May 31, 2017" "libcurl 7.63.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"

.SH NAME
CURLOPT_SSH_PRIVATE_KEYFILE \- set private key file for SSH auth
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_SSH_PRIVATE_KEYFILE,
                          char *filename);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a char * pointing to a \fIfilename\fP for your private key. If not used,
libcurl defaults to \fB$HOME/.ssh/id_dsa\fP if the HOME environment variable
is set, and just "id_dsa" in the current directory if HOME is not set.

If the file is password-protected, set the password with
\fICURLOPT_KEYPASSWD(3)\fP.

The application does not have to keep the string around after setting this
option.
