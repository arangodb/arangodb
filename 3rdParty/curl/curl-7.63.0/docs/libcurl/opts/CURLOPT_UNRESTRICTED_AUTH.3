.TH CURLOPT_UNRESTRICTED_AUTH 3 "May 15, 2017" "libcurl 7.63.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"

.SH NAME
CURLOPT_UNRESTRICTED_AUTH \- send credentials to other hosts too
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_UNRESTRICTED_AUTH,
                          long goahead);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Set the long \fIgohead\fP parameter to 1L to make libcurl continue to send
authentication (user+password) credentials when following locations, even when
hostname changed. This option is meaningful only when setting
\fICURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION(3)\fP.

By default, libcurl will only send given credentials to the initial host name
as given in the original URL, to avoid leaking username + password to other
sites.
.SH DEFAULT
0

  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_UNRESTRICTED_AUTH, 1L);
