.TH CURLOPT_ISSUERCERT 3 "May 31, 2017" "libcurl 7.63.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"

.SH NAME
CURLOPT_ISSUERCERT \- issuer SSL certificate filename
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_ISSUERCERT, char *file);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a char * to a zero terminated string naming a \fIfile\fP holding a CA
certificate in PEM format. If the option is set, an additional check against
the peer certificate is performed to verify the issuer is indeed the one
associated with the certificate provided by the option. This additional check
is useful in multi-level PKI where one needs to enforce that the peer
certificate is from a specific branch of the tree.

This option makes sense only when used in combination with the
\fICURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER(3)\fP option. Otherwise, the result of the check is
not considered as failure.

A specific error code (CURLE_SSL_ISSUER_ERROR) is defined with the option,
which is returned if the setup of the SSL/TLS session has failed due to a
mismatch with the issuer of peer certificate (\fICURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER(3)\fP
has to be set too for the check to fail). (Added in 7.19.0)

The application does not have to keep the string around after setting this
option.
.SH DEFAULT
NULL
.SH PROTOCOLS
