.TH CURLOPT_MAXCONNECTS 3 "May 30, 2017" "libcurl 7.63.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"

.SH NAME
CURLOPT_MAXCONNECTS \- maximum connection cache size
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_MAXCONNECTS, long amount);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a long. The set \fIamount\fP will be the maximum number of simultaneously
open persistent connections that libcurl may cache in the pool associated with
this handle. The default is 5, and there isn't much point in changing this
value unless you are perfectly aware of how this works and changes libcurl's
behaviour. This concerns connections using any of the protocols that support
persistent connections.

When reaching the maximum limit, curl closes the oldest one in the cache to
prevent increasing the number of open connections.

If you already have performed transfers with this curl handle, setting a
smaller \fICURLOPT_MAXCONNECTS(3)\fP than before may cause open connections to
get closed unnecessarily.

If you add this easy handle to a multi handle, this setting is not
acknowledged, and you must instead use \fIcurl_multi_setopt(3)\fP and the
\fICURLMOPT_MAXCONNECTS(3)\fP option.
.SH DEFAULT
5
