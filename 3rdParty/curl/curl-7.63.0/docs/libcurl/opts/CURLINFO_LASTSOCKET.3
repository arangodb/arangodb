.TH CURLINFO_LASTSOCKET 3 "May 06, 2017" "libcurl 7.63.0" "curl_easy_getinfo options"

.SH NAME
CURLINFO_LASTSOCKET \- get the last socket used
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_getinfo(CURL *handle, CURLINFO_LASTSOCKET, long *socket);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Deprecated since 7.45.0. Use \fICURLINFO_ACTIVESOCKET(3)\fP instead.

Pass a pointer to a long to receive the last socket used by this curl
session. If the socket is no longer valid, -1 is returned. When you finish
working with the socket, you must call curl_easy_cleanup() as usual and let
libcurl close the socket and cleanup other resources associated with the
handle. This is typically used in combination with
\fICURLOPT_CONNECT_ONLY(3)\fP.

NOTE: this API is deprecated since it is not working on win64 where the SOCKET
type is 64 bits large while its 'long' is 32 bits. Use the
\fICURLINFO_ACTIVESOCKET(3)\fP instead, if possible.
.SH PROTOCOLS
All
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
if(curl) {
  long sockfd; /* doesn't work on win64! */
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "http://example.com");

  /* Do not do the transfer - only connect to host */
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_CONNECT_ONLY, 1L);
  res = curl_easy_perform(curl);

  /* Extract the socket from the curl handle */
  res = curl_easy_getinfo(curl, CURLINFO_LASTSOCKET, &sockfd);

  if(res != CURLE_OK) {
    printf("Error: %s\\n", curl_easy_strerror(res));
    return 1;
  }
}
.fi
.SH AVAILABILITY
