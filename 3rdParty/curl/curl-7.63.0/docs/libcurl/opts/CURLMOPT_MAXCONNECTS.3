.TH CURLMOPT_MAXCONNECTS 3 "September 23, 2018" "libcurl 7.63.0" "curl_multi_setopt options"

.SH NAME
CURLMOPT_MAXCONNECTS \- set size of connection cache
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLMcode curl_multi_setopt(CURLM *handle, CURLMOPT_MAXCONNECTS, long max);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a long indicating the \fBmax\fP. The set number will be used as the
maximum amount of simultaneously open connections that libcurl may keep in its
connection cache after completed use. By default libcurl will enlarge the size
for each added easy handle to make it fit 4 times the number of added easy
handles.

By setting this option, you can prevent the cache size from growing beyond the
limit set by you.

When the cache is full, curl closes the oldest one in the cache to prevent the
number of open connections from increasing.

This option is for the multi handle's use only, when using the easy interface
you should instead use the \fICURLOPT_MAXCONNECTS(3)\fP option.

See \fICURLMOPT_MAX_TOTAL_CONNECTIONS(3)\fP for limiting the number of active
connections.
