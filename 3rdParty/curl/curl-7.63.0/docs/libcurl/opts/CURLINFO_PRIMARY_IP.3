.TH CURLINFO_PRIMARY_IP 3 "March 22, 2017" "libcurl 7.63.0" "curl_easy_getinfo options"

.SH NAME
CURLINFO_PRIMARY_IP \- get IP address of last connection
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_getinfo(CURL *handle, CURLINFO_PRIMARY_IP, char **ip);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a pointer to a char pointer to receive the pointer to a zero-terminated
string holding the IP address of the most recent connection done with this
\fBcurl\fP handle. This string may be IPv6 when that is enabled. Note that you
get a pointer to a memory area that will be re-used at next request so you
need to copy the string if you want to keep the information.

The \fBip\fP pointer will be NULL or pointing to private memory you MUST NOT
free - it gets freed when you call \fIcurl_easy_cleanup(3)\fP on the
corresponding CURL handle.
.SH PROTOCOLS
All network based ones
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
{
  char *ip;

  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "http://example.com");

  /* Perform the request, res will get the return code */
  res = curl_easy_perform(curl);
  /* Check for errors */
  if((res == CURLE_OK) &&
     !curl_easy_getinfo(curl, CURLINFO_PRIMARY_IP, &ip) && ip) {
    printf("IP: %s\\n", ip);
  }

  /* always cleanup */
  curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
}
