.TH CURLOPT_KRBLEVEL 3 "May 31, 2017" "libcurl 7.63.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"

.SH NAME
CURLOPT_KRBLEVEL \- set FTP kerberos security level
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_KRBLEVEL, char *level);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a char * as parameter. Set the kerberos security level for FTP; this also
enables kerberos awareness.  This is a string that should match one of the
following: \&'clear', \&'safe', \&'confidential' or \&'private'.  If the
string is set but doesn't match one of these, 'private' will be used. Set the
string to NULL to disable kerberos support for FTP.

The application does not have to keep the string around after setting this
option.
