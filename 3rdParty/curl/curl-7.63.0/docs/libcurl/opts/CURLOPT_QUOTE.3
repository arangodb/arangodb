.TH CURLOPT_QUOTE 3 "April 17, 2018" "libcurl 7.63.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"

.SH NAME
CURLOPT_QUOTE \- (S)FTP commands to run before transfer
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_QUOTE, struct curl_slist *cmds);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a pointer to a linked list of FTP or SFTP commands to pass to the server
prior to your request. This will be done before any other commands are issued
(even before the CWD command for FTP). The linked list should be a fully valid
list of 'struct curl_slist' structs properly filled in with text strings. Use
\fIcurl_slist_append(3)\fP to append strings (commands) to the list, and clear
the entire list afterwards with \fIcurl_slist_free_all(3)\fP. Disable this
operation again by setting a NULL to this option. When speaking to an FTP
server, prefix the command with an asterisk (*) to make libcurl continue even
if the command fails as by default libcurl will stop at first failure.

The set of valid FTP commands depends on the server (see RFC959 for a list of
mandatory commands).

The valid SFTP commands are:
.RS
.IP "chgrp group file"
The chgrp command sets the group ID of the file named by the file operand to
the group ID specified by the group operand. The group operand is a decimal
integer group ID.
.IP "chmod mode file"
The chmod command modifies the file mode bits of the specified file. The
mode operand is an octal integer mode number.
.IP "chown user file"
The chown command sets the owner of the file named by the file operand to the
user ID specified by the user operand. The user operand is a decimal
integer user ID.
.IP "ln source_file target_file"
The ln and symlink commands create a symbolic link at the target_file location
pointing to the source_file location.
.IP "mkdir directory_name"
The mkdir command creates the directory named by the directory_name operand.
.IP "pwd"
The pwd command returns the absolute pathname of the current working directory.
.IP "rename source target"
The rename command renames the file or directory named by the source
operand to the destination path named by the target operand.
.IP "rm file"
The rm command removes the file specified by the file operand.
.IP "rmdir directory"
The rmdir command removes the directory entry specified by the directory
operand, provided it is empty.
.IP "statvfs file"
The statvfs command returns statistics on the file system in which specified
file resides. (Added in 7.49.0)
.IP "symlink source_file target_file"
See ln.
.RE
.SH DEFAULT
NULL
.SH PROTOCOLS
SFTP and FTP
