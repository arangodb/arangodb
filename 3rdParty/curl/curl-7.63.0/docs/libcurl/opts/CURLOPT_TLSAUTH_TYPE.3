.TH CURLOPT_TLSAUTH_TYPE 3 "May 31, 2017" "libcurl 7.63.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"

.SH NAME
CURLOPT_TLSAUTH_TYPE \- set TLS authentication methods
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_TLSAUTH_TYPE, char *type);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as parameter. The string
should be the method of the TLS authentication. Supported method is "SRP".

.IP SRP
TLS-SRP authentication. Secure Remote Password authentication for TLS is
defined in RFC5054 and provides mutual authentication if both sides have a
shared secret. To use TLS-SRP, you must also set the
\fICURLOPT_TLSAUTH_USERNAME(3)\fP and \fICURLOPT_TLSAUTH_PASSWORD(3)\fP
options.

The application does not have to keep the string around after setting this
option.
.SH DEFAULT
blank
.SH PROTOCOLS
All TLS-based protocols
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
if(curl) {
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com/");
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_TLSAUTH_TYPE, "SRP");
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_TLSAUTH_USERNAME, "user");
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_TLSAUTH_PASSWORD, "secret");
  ret = curl_easy_perform(curl);
  curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
}
.fi
.SH AVAILABILITY
You need to build libcurl with GnuTLS or OpenSSL with TLS-SRP support for this
to work. Added in 7.21.4
.SH RETURN VALUE
