.TH CURLOPT_INFILESIZE 3 "February 03, 2016" "libcurl 7.63.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"

.SH NAME
CURLOPT_INFILESIZE \- set size of the input file to send off
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_INFILESIZE, long filesize);
.SH DESCRIPTION
When uploading a file to a remote site, \fIfilesize\fP should be used to tell
libcurl what the expected size of the input file is. This value must be passed
as a long. See also \fICURLOPT_INFILESIZE_LARGE(3)\fP for sending files larger
than 2GB.

For uploading using SCP, this option or \fICURLOPT_INFILESIZE_LARGE(3)\fP is
mandatory.

To unset this value again, set it to -1.

When sending emails using SMTP, this command can be used to specify the
optional SIZE parameter for the MAIL FROM command.

This option does not limit how much data libcurl will actually send, as that
is controlled entirely by what the read callback returns, but telling one
value and sending a different amount may lead to errors.
.SH DEFAULT
Unset
