.TH CURLOPT_FRESH_CONNECT 3 "May 31, 2017" "libcurl 7.63.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"

.SH NAME
CURLOPT_FRESH_CONNECT \- force a new connection to be used
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_FRESH_CONNECT, long fresh);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a long. Set to 1 to make the next transfer use a new (fresh) connection
by force instead of trying to re-use an existing one.  This option should be
used with caution and only if you understand what it does as it may seriously
impact performance.

Related functionality is \fICURLOPT_FORBID_REUSE(3)\fP which makes sure the
connection is closed after use so that it won't be re-used.

Set \fIfresh\fP to 0 to have libcurl attempt re-using an existing connection
(default behavior).
