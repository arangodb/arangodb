.TH CURLOPT_PROXYUSERPWD 3 "May 30, 2017" "libcurl 7.63.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"

.SH NAME
CURLOPT_PROXYUSERPWD \- user name and password to use for proxy authentication
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_PROXYUSERPWD, char *userpwd);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a char * as parameter, which should be [user name]:[password] to use for
the connection to the HTTP proxy. Both the name and the password will be URL
decoded before use, so to include for example a colon in the user name you
should encode it as %3A. (This is different to how \fICURLOPT_USERPWD(3)\fP is
used - beware.)

Use \fICURLOPT_PROXYAUTH(3)\fP to specify the authentication method.

The application does not have to keep the string around after setting this
option.
.SH DEFAULT
This is NULL by default.
.SH PROTOCOLS
Used with all protocols that can use a proxy
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
if(curl) {
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "http://example.com/foo.bin");
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_PROXY, "http://localhost:8080");
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_PROXYUSERPWD, "clark%20kent:superman");
  ret = curl_easy_perform(curl);
  curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
}
.fi
.SH AVAILABILITY
Always
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns CURLE_OK if proxies are supported, CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not, or
CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY if there was insufficient heap space.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR CURLOPT_PROXY "(3), " CURLOPT_PROXYTYPE "(3), "
