.TH CURLOPT_FTP_USE_EPRT 3 "February 03, 2016" "libcurl 7.63.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"

.SH NAME
CURLOPT_FTP_USE_EPRT \- enable/disable use of EPRT with FTP
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_FTP_USE_EPRT, long enabled);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a long. If the value is 1, it tells curl to use the EPRT command when
doing active FTP downloads (which is enabled by
\fICURLOPT_FTPPORT(3)\fP). Using EPRT means that it will first attempt to use
EPRT before using PORT, but if you pass zero to this option, it will not try
using EPRT, only plain PORT.

If the server is an IPv6 host, this option will have no effect as EPRT is
necessary then.
