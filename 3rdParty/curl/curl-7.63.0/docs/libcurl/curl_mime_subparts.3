.TH curl_mime_subparts 3 "September 05, 2017" "libcurl 7.63.0" "libcurl Manual"

.SH NAME
curl_mime_subparts - set subparts of a multipart mime part
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <curl/curl.h>
.sp
.BI "CURLcode curl_mime_subparts(curl_mimepart * " part ,
.BI "curl_mime * " subparts ");"
.ad
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIcurl_mime_subparts(3)\fP sets a multipart mime part's content from a mime
structure.

\fIpart\fP is a handle to the multipart part.

\fIsubparts\fP is a mime structure handle holding the subparts. After
\fIcurl_mime_subparts\fP succeeds, the mime structure handle belongs to the
multipart part and must not be freed explicitly. It may however be updated by
subsequent calls to mime API functions.

Setting a part's contents twice is valid: only the value set by the last call
is retained. It is possible to unassign previous part's contents by setting
\fIsubparts\fP to NULL.
.SH AVAILABILITY
As long as at least one of HTTP, SMTP or IMAP is enabled. Added in 7.56.0.
.SH RETURN VALUE
CURLE_OK or a CURL error code upon failure.
