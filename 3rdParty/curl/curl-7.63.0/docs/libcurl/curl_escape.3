.TH curl_escape 3 "February 03, 2016" "libcurl 7.63.0" "libcurl Manual"

.SH NAME
curl_escape - URL encodes the given string
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <curl/curl.h>
.sp
.BI "char *curl_escape( const char *" url ", int "length " );"
.ad
.SH DESCRIPTION
Obsolete function. Use \fIcurl_easy_escape(3)\fP instead!

This function will convert the given input string to an URL encoded string and
return that as a new allocated string. All input characters that are not a-z,
A-Z or 0-9 will be converted to their "URL escaped" version (%NN where NN is a
two-digit hexadecimal number).

If the 'length' argument is set to 0, curl_escape() will use strlen() on the
input 'url' string to find out the size.

You must curl_free() the returned string when you're done with it.
.SH AVAILABILITY
Since 7.15.4, \fIcurl_easy_escape(3)\fP should be used. This function will
be removed in a future release.
.SH RETURN VALUE
A pointer to a zero terminated string or NULL if it failed.
