.SH NAME
curl_global_cleanup - global libcurl cleanup
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <curl/curl.h>
.sp
.BI "void curl_global_cleanup(void);"
.ad
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function releases resources acquired by \fIcurl_global_init(3)\fP.

You should call \fIcurl_global_cleanup(3)\fP once for each call you make to
\fIcurl_global_init(3)\fP, after you are done using libcurl.

\fBThis function is not thread safe.\fP You must not call it when any other
thread in the program (i.e. a thread sharing the same memory) is running.
This doesn't just mean no other thread that is using libcurl.  Because
\fIcurl_global_cleanup(3)\fP calls functions of other libraries that are
similarly thread unsafe, it could conflict with any other thread that uses
these other libraries.

See the description in \fIlibcurl(3)\fP of global environment requirements for
details of how to use this function.
.SH CAUTION
\fIcurl_global_cleanup(3)\fP does not block waiting for any libcurl-created
threads to terminate (such as threads used for name resolving). If a module
containing libcurl is dynamically unloaded while libcurl-created threads are
still running then your program may crash or other corruption may occur. We
recommend you do not run libcurl from any module that may be unloaded
dynamically. This behavior may be addressed in the future.
