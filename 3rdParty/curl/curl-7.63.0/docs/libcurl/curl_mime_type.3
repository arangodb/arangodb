.TH curl_mime_type 3 "April 17, 2018" "libcurl 7.63.0" "libcurl Manual"

.SH NAME
curl_mime_type - set a mime part's content type
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <curl/curl.h>
.sp
.BI "CURLcode curl_mime_type(curl_mimepart * " part ,
.BI "const char * " mimetype ");"
.ad
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIcurl_mime_type(3)\fP sets a mime part's content type.

\fIpart\fP is the part's handle to assign the content type to.

\fImimetype\fP points to the nul-terminated file mime type string; it may be
set to NULL to remove a previously attached mime type.

The mime type string is copied into the part, thus the associated storage may
safely be released or reused after call. Setting a part's type twice is valid:
only the value set by the last call is retained.

In the absence of a mime type and if needed by the protocol specifications,
a default mime type is determined by the context:
.br
- If set as a custom header, use this value.
.br
- application/form-data for an HTTP form post.
.br
- If a remote file name is set, the mime type is taken from the file name
extension, or application/octet-stream by default.
.br
- For a multipart part, multipart/mixed.
.br
- text/plain in other cases.
.SH AVAILABILITY
As long as at least one of HTTP, SMTP or IMAP is enabled. Added in 7.56.0.
.SH RETURN VALUE
CURLE_OK or a CURL error code upon failure.
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
 curl_mime *mime;
 curl_mimepart *part;

 /* create a mime handle */
 mime = curl_mime_init(easy);

 /* add a part */
 part = curl_mime_addpart(mime);

 /* get data from this file */
 curl_mime_filedata(part, "image.png");

 /* content-type for this part */
 curl_mime_type(part, "image/png");

 /* set name */
 curl_mime_name(part, "image");
