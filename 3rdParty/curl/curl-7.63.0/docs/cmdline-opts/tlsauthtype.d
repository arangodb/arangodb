Set TLS authentication type. Currently, the only supported option is "SRP",
for TLS-SRP (RFC 5054). If --tlsuser and --tlspassword are specified but
--tlsauthtype is not, then this option defaults to "SRP".  This option works
only if the underlying libcurl is built with TLS-SRP support, which requires
OpenSSL or GnuTLS with TLS-SRP support.
