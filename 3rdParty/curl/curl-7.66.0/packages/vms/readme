How to Build:

The GNV based build and the DCL based build procedures are not compatible
and you must make sure that none of the build files are present before
running a different type of build.  Use the "REALCLEAN" option for
BUILD_VMS.COM and the "REALCLEAN" option for clean_gnv_curl.com.

The (brute-force) DCL based builder is [.packages.vms]build_vms.com.
Comments in this procedure describe various optional parameters which
enable or disable optional program features, or which control the build
in other ways.  Product files (.EXE, .H, .LIS, .MAP, .OBJ, .OLB, ...)
should be produced in an architecture-specific subdirectory under this
directory ([.ALPHA], [.IA64], [.VAX]).

The file curl_gnv_build_steps.txt contains information on buildling using
the GNV tool kit, building a shared libcurl, and producting a PCSI kit for
distribution.  The curl_gnv_build_steps.text is included in the release
notes file of the PCSI kit.

The building with 64 bit pointers does not currently work.

The build procedure will detect if HP OpenSSL, LDAP, and Kerberos are
installed and default to building with them.

The build procedure will also detect if a compatible ZLIB shared image
is installed from a PCSI kit and default to using it.

   Example build commands:

      @ [.packages.vms]build_vms.com CLEAN
      @ [.packages.vms]build_vms.com LARGE LDAP
      submit /noprint [.packages.vms]build_vms.com /param = (LARGE, LDAP)

The build_vms.com procedure does not build the shared image file or the PCSI
kit.  If you have built a curl with ZLIB and HPSSL support as well as if
LDAP and Kerberos installed, you can use the GNV_LINK_CURL.COM file.

The GNV_LINK_CURL.COM contains information on how to link and run with a newer
version of HP SSL than what may be install on an Alpha or IA64 based system.

To build the PCSI kit, follow the the instructions in the file
curl_gnv_build_steps.txt.

Other Notes:

This release fixes known bugs #22, and #57 in the [curl.docs]known_bugs.
file.

The libcurl formdata.c module and Curl tools post form now have some
understanding of VMS file types.  Files will be posted in STREAM_LF format.

The Curl tool now has some understanding of VMS file types and will upload the
files in STREAM_LF fomat.

When CURL is uploading a VARIABLE format VMS file, it is less efficient as in
order to get the file size, it will first read the entire file once, and then
read the file again for the actual upload.

The Curl tool will now always download files into STREAM_LF format.  Even if a
file by that name with a different format already exists.  This is needed to
allow interrupted downloads to be continued.


The libcurl file module still does not understand VMS file types and requires
the input files to be in STREAM_LF to work property.

The test suites are not supported as of 7.11.0.

The curlmsg.sdl and curlmsg.h files are generated from curlmsg.msg.
This is not done automatically, since the .MSG file is a hand edit
of the relevant stuff from the curl.h file.  If you want to do this
yourself you'll need the SDL package from the freeware collection.
