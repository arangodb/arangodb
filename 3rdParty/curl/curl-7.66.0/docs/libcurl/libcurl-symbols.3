.SH NAME
libcurl-symbols \- libcurl symbol version information
.SH "libcurl symbols"
This man page details version information for public symbols provided in the
libcurl header files. This lists the first version in which the symbol was
introduced and for some symbols two additional information pieces:

The first version in which the symbol is marked "deprecated" - meaning that
since that version no new code should be written to use the symbol as it is
marked for getting removed in a future.

The last version that featured the specific symbol. Using the symbol in source
code will make it no longer compile error-free after that specified version.

This man page is automatically generated from the symbols-in-versions file.
