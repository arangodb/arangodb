This directory contains a sample Python extension module which 
includes PyWinTypes.h and links against PyWinTypesXX.lib  The same technique 
can be used to include and extend pythoncom.

The sample does nothing useful other than to show how to compile and link
such an extension using a standard pywin32 installation.
