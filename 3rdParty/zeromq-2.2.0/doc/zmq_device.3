.SH "NAME"
zmq_device \- start built\-in 0MQ device
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBint zmq_device (int \fR\fB\fIdevice\fR\fR\fB, const void \fR\fB\fI*frontend\fR\fR\fB, const void \fR\fB\fI*backend\fR\fR\fB);\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The \fIzmq_device()\fR function starts a built\-in 0MQ device\&. The \fIdevice\fR argument is one of:
.PP
\fIZMQ_QUEUE\fR
.RS 4
starts a queue device
.RE
.PP
\fIZMQ_FORWARDER\fR
.RS 4
starts a forwarder device
.RE
.PP
\fIZMQ_STREAMER\fR
.RS 4
starts a streamer device
.RE
.sp
The device connects a frontend socket to a backend socket\&. Conceptually, data flows from frontend to backend\&. Depending on the socket types, replies may flow in the opposite direction\&.
.sp
Before calling \fIzmq_device()\fR you must set any socket options, and connect or bind both frontend and backend sockets\&. The two conventional device models are:
.PP
\fBproxy\fR
.RS 4
bind frontend socket to an endpoint, and connect backend socket to downstream components\&. A proxy device model does not require changes to the downstream topology but that topology is static (any changes require reconfiguring the device)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBbroker\fR
.RS 4
bind frontend socket to one endpoint and bind backend socket to a second endpoint\&. Downstream components must now connect into the device\&. A broker device model allows a dynamic downstream topology (components can come and go at any time)\&.
.RE
.sp
\fIzmq_device()\fR runs in the current thread and returns only if/when the current context is closed\&.
.SH "QUEUE DEVICE"
.sp
\fIZMQ_QUEUE\fR creates a shared queue that collects requests from a set of clients, and distributes these fairly among a set of services\&. Requests are fair\-queued from frontend connections and load\-balanced between backend connections\&. Replies automatically return to the client that made the original request\&.
.sp
This device is part of the \fIrequest\-reply\fR pattern\&. The frontend speaks to clients and the backend speaks to services\&. You should use \fIZMQ_QUEUE\fR with a \fIZMQ_XREP\fR socket for the frontend and a \fIZMQ_XREQ\fR socket for the backend\&. Other combinations are not documented\&.
.sp
Refer to \fBzmq_socket\fR(3) for a description of these socket types\&.
.SH "FORWARDER DEVICE"
.sp
\fIZMQ_FORWARDER\fR collects messages from a set of publishers and forwards these to a set of subscribers\&. You will generally use this to bridge networks, e\&.g\&. read on TCP unicast and forward on multicast\&.
.sp
This device is part of the \fIpublish\-subscribe\fR pattern\&. The frontend speaks to publishers and the backend speaks to subscribers\&. You should use \fIZMQ_FORWARDER\fR with a \fIZMQ_SUB\fR socket for the frontend and a \fIZMQ_PUB\fR socket for the backend\&. Other combinations are not documented\&.
.sp
Refer to \fBzmq_socket\fR(3) for a description of these socket types\&.
.SH "STREAMER DEVICE"
.sp
\fIZMQ_STREAMER\fR collects tasks from a set of pushers and forwards these to a set of pullers\&. You will generally use this to bridge networks\&. Messages are fair\-queued from pushers and load\-balanced to pullers\&.
.sp
This device is part of the \fIpipeline\fR pattern\&. The frontend speaks to pushers and the backend speaks to pullers\&. You should use \fIZMQ_STREAMER\fR with a \fIZMQ_PULL\fR socket for the frontend and a \fIZMQ_PUSH\fR socket for the backend\&. Other combinations are not documented\&.
.sp
Refer to \fBzmq_socket\fR(3) for a description of these socket types\&.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.sp
The \fIzmq_device()\fR function always returns \-1 and \fIerrno\fR set to \fBETERM\fR (the 0MQ \fIcontext\fR associated with either of the specified sockets was terminated)\&.
.SH "EXAMPLE"
.PP
\fBCreating a queue broker\fR. 
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
//  Create frontend and backend sockets
void *frontend = zmq_socket (context, ZMQ_XREP);
assert (backend);
void *backend = zmq_socket (context, ZMQ_XREQ);
assert (frontend);
//  Bind both sockets to TCP ports
assert (zmq_bind (frontend, "tcp://*:5555") == 0);
assert (zmq_bind (backend, "tcp://*:5556") == 0);
//  Start a queue device
zmq_device (ZMQ_QUEUE, frontend, backend);
