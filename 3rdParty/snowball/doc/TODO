Things to do:

 - Write documentation for how to use libstemmer (as opposed to how stemming
   algorithms themselves work).
   Currently, the documentation in the include/libstemmer.h header file is
   pretty clear and comprehensive, but an overview document wouldn't go amiss.

Things that would be nice to include at some point.

 - Add version numbers to each stemming algorithm, and allow the interface to
   request a specific version of the stemming algorithms.  Default to providing
   the latest version of the algorithm.
 - Make mkmodules.pl generate the build system, instead of being called from it.
   This would allow it to generate the list of modules to be built, so that it's
   not necessary to change things in more than one place to add a new algorithm.
