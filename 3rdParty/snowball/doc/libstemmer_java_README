libstemmer_java
===============

This document pertains to the Java version of the libstemmer distribution,
available for download from:

http://snowballstem.org/dist/libstemmer_java.tgz


Compiling the library
=====================

Simply run the java compiler on all the java source files under the java
directory.  For example, this can be done under unix by changing directory into
the java directory, and running:

 javac org/tartarus/snowball/*.java org/tartarus/snowball/ext/*.java

This will compile the library and also an example program "TestApp" which
provides a command line interface to the library.


Using the library
=================

There is currently no formal documentation on the use of the Java version
of the library.  Additionally, its interface is not guaranteed to be
stable.

The best documentation of the library is the source of the TestApp example
program.


The TestApp example
===================

The TestApp example program allows you to run any of the stemmers
compiled into the libstemmer library on a sample vocabulary.  For
details on how to use it, run it with no command line parameters.
