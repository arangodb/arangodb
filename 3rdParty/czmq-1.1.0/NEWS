CZMQ version 1.1.0 (stable), released on 2011/08/30
===================================================

Changes
-------

* Fixed issue CZMQ-2. (https://zeromq.jira.com/browse/CZMQ-2)

* Removed unused ctx argument from zthread_new() call.

* zloop works with zmq_pollitem_t * instead of void * sockets; allows
  use of native FDs in reactor as well as 0MQ sockets.

* zloop_reader renamed to zloop_poller.

* zloop_cancel renamed to zloop_poller_end, and API changed to work with
  zmq_pollitem_t * instead of a single 0MQ socket void *.

* Added zloop_timer_end, taking same argument as for zloop_timer.

* zloop_poller_end cancels ALL handlers for the socket or FD.

* Added zmsg_content_size method to report full content size of message.

* zmsg_save returns 0/-1 depending on success/failure (previously returned
  void).

* zmsg_dump limited to first 10 frames, to allow mix of large and small
  messages in applications.

* zframe_print truncates output at 70 chars to prevent over-long output.

* Added ability for zsocket_bind to bind to ephemeral port in range 0xc000
  to 0xffff.

* zmq_bind always returns port number bound to, if successful.

* Added zfile class with minimal helper functions.

* Added zfile_size method to return file size, as ssize_t.

* Added socket multipart flush to zctx_destroy to work around libzmq issue
  134, which asserts if a fair-queuing socket still has input at close.

* Added zframe_eq method to compare two frames' size and content.

* Changed zmsg_load to append to an optional existing message.

* Fixed zloop to allow timers to be added after reactor was started.
  Without this fix, the reactor would spin at max speed instead of
  properly calculating the timer. (Luc Heinrich)

* Modified zmsg_pushstr and zmsg_addstr to accept variable argument list
  and do vsnprintf formatting of provided string.

* Added zhash_rename function to allow soft renaming of item keys.

* Added tblsize and tbllast macros, so very useful when you need them.

* Added zmsg_encode and zmsg_decode functions to serialize messages to
  and from a byte buffer.

* Added zframe_recv_nowait method to read frame without blocking.


CZMQ version 1.0.0 (stable), released on 2011/04/26
===================================================

Changes
-------

* At build time, reports error if libzmq version isn't at least 2.1.

* Renamed project to CZMQ for coherence with other language bindings.


libzapi version 1.3.2 (beta), released on 2011/04/15
====================================================

Changes
-------

* Added zsocket_type_str method to return printable socket type.

* Added zloop_set_verbose method to enable/disable reactor activity.

* Fixed zloop to call right handlers even if handlers register/cancel
  other handlers.

* Fixed zloop to not call handlers when interrupted.

* Added zsocket_set_hwm method to emulate 2.x option (sets both send
  and recv high-water marks).

* Several parts of the 3.0 porting didn't work properly - fixed.

* Added macro set to aid portability from 2.1 to 3.0: ZMQ_POLL_MSEC,
  ZMQ_DONTWAIT, zmq_sendmsg, zmq_recvmsg.


libzapi version 1.3.1 (beta), released on 2011/04/09
====================================================

Changes
-------

* Added compatibility for new libzmq/3.0 API.


libzapi version 1.3.0 (beta), released on 2011/04/08
====================================================

Changes
-------

* Ported to win32, all selftests pass successfully.

* New zsockopt class provides API to set/get socket options.

* New zsocket class provides API to connect and bind sockets using
  printf semantics to format endpoints.

* Threading API now supports detached and attached threads via zthread
  class, and zthread_new and zthread_fork methods.

* Pipes to attached threads have HWM of 1 (each side) to block runaway
  writers.

* In zframe class, added print, reset, strdup, streq, strhex, dup methods.

* In zmsg class, added last, wrap, unwrap, popstr, pushstr, addstr, dup
  methods.

* In zclock class, added log method.

* In zstr class, added sendm and recv_nowait methods.

* Added Valgrind suppression file for libzmq.

Bug Fixes
---------

* Fixed error in thread pipe handling which sometimes provoked libzmq
  assertion failure at shutdown.


libzapi version 1.2.1 (beta), released on 2011/04/01
====================================================

Changes
-------

* Rewrote zctx class, which was wrongly working with sockets in two
  threads. Much simpler, and properly stable now.

* Project renamed to 'libzapi' for consistency with 'libzmq'.

* Expanded main documentation page significantly.


zapi version 1.2.0 (beta), released on 2011/03/24
=================================================

Changes
-------

* Added zclock class for portable millisecond timers and delays.

* Expanded documentation significantly.


zapi version 1.1.0 (beta), released on 2011/03/23
=================================================

Changes
-------

* Added zctx_thread_new method to create child threads with a PAIR pipe
  to talk to them.

* Made zapi threadsafe, specifically multiple threads can share the same
  context and thus talk to each other.


zapi version 1.0.0 (beta), released on 2011/03/22
=================================================

Changes
-------

* Initial version of library finished, tested, documented, and packaged.
