// Given a set of possibly self-intersecting closed loops, this class computes
// a partitioning of the sphere into regions of constant winding number and
// returns the subset of those regions selected by a given winding rule.  This
// functionality can be used to implement N-way boolean polygon operations
// including union, intersection, and symmetric difference, as well as more
// exotic operations such as buffering and Minkowski sums.
//
// Recall that in the plane, the winding number of a closed curve around a
// point is an integer representing the number of times the curve travels
// counterclockwise around that point.  For example, points in the interior of
// a planar simple polygon with counterclockwise boundary have a winding
// number of +1, while points outside the polygon have a winding number of 0.
// If the boundary is clockwise then points in the interior have a winding
// number of -1.
//
// The interior of a complex self-intersecting closed boundary curve may be
// defined by choosing an appropriate winding rule.  For example, the interior
// could be defined as all regions whose winding number is positive, or all
// regions whose winding number is non-zero, or all regions whose winding
// number is odd.  Different winding rules are useful for implementing the
// various operations mentioned above (union, symmetric difference, etc).
//
// Unfortunately the concept of winding number on the sphere is not
// well-defined, due to the fact that a given closed curve does not partition
// the sphere into regions of constant winding number.  This is because the
// winding number changes when a point crosses either the given curve or that
// curve's reflection through the origin.
//
// Instead we engage in a slight abuse of terminology by modifying the concept
// of winding number on the sphere to be a relative one.  Given a set of
// closed curves on the sphere and the winding number of a reference point R,
// we define the winding number of every other point P by counting signed edge
// crossings.  When the edge RP crosses from the right side of a curve to its
// left the winding number increases by one, and when the edge RP crosses from
// the left side of a curve to its right the winding number decreases by one.
//
// This definition agrees with the classical one in the plane when R is taken
// to be the point at infinity with a winding number of zero.  It also agrees
// with the rule used by the S2 library to define polygon interiors, namely
// that the interior of a loop is the region to its left.  And most
// importantly, it satisfies the property that a closed curve partitions the
// sphere into regions of constant winding number.

    //    combination of points, polylines, and polygons.
