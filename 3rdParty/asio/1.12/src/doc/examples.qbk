[section:examples Examples]


* [link asio.examples.cpp03_examples C++03 Examples]: Illustrates the use of
Asio using only C++03 language and library features. Where necessary, the
examples make use of selected Boost C++ libraries.

* [link asio.examples.cpp11_examples C++11 Examples]: Contains a limited set of
the C++03 Asio examples, updated to use only C++11 library and language
facilities. These examples do not make direct use of Boost C++ libraries.
[/boostify: non-boost docs start here]
To show the changes between C++03 and C++11, these examples include a diff
between the C++03 and C++11 versions.
