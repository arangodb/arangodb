[section:CompletionCondition Completion condition requirements]

A ['completion condition] is a function object that is used with the algorithms
[link asio.reference.read `read`], [link asio.reference.async_read
`async_read`], [link asio.reference.write `write`], and [link
asio.reference.async_write `async_write`] to determine when the algorithm has
completed transferring data.

A type `X` meets the `CompletionCondition` requirements if it satisfies the
requirements of `Destructible` (C++Std [destructible]) and
`CopyConstructible` (C++Std [copyconstructible]), as well as the additional
requirements listed below.

In the table below, `x` denotes a value of type `X`, `ec` denotes a (possibly
const) value of type `error_code`, and `n` denotes a (possibly const) value of
type `size_t`.

      Let `n` be the total number of bytes transferred by the read or write
      algorithm so far.\n
      \n
      Returns the maximum number of bytes to be transferred on the next
      `read_some`, `async_read_some`, `write_some`, or `async_write_some`
      operation performed by the algorithm. Returns `0` to indicate that the
      algorithm is complete.
