[section:SyncReadStream Buffer-oriented synchronous read stream requirements]

A type `X` meets the `SyncReadStream` requirements if it satisfies the
requirements listed below.

In the table below, `a` denotes a value of type `X`, `mb` denotes a (possibly
const) value satisfying the [link asio.reference.MutableBufferSequence
`MutableBufferSequence`] requirements, and `ec` denotes an object of type
`error_code`.

     `a.read_some(mb,ec)`]

      Meets the requirements for a [link asio.reference.read_write_operations
      read operation].\n
      \n
      If `buffer_size(mb) > 0`, reads one or more bytes of data from the stream
      `a` into the buffer sequence `mb`. If successful, sets `ec` such that
      `!ec` is `true`, and returns the number of bytes read. If an error
      occurred, sets `ec` such that `!!ec` is `true`, and returns 0. If all
      data has been read from the stream, and the stream performed an orderly
      shutdown, sets `ec` to `stream_errc::eof` and returns 0.\n
      \n
      If `buffer_size(mb) == 0`, the operation shall not block. Sets `ec` such
      that `!ec` is `true`, and returns 0.
