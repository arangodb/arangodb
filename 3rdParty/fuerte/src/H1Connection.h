    // Normally, the value is 0. If the idle alarm goes off, it first
    // compare-exchanges this value from 0 to -1, then shuts down the
    // connection (setting the _state to Failed in the TLS case). After
    // that, the value is set back to 0.
    // The lease operation tries to compare-exchange the value from 0 to 1,
    // and if this has worked, it checks again that the _state is not Failed.
    // This means, that if a lease has happened successfully, the idle alarm
    // does no longer shut down the connection.
    // If `sendRequest` is called on the connection (typically after a lease),
    // a compare-exchange operation from 1 to 2 is tried. The value 2 indicates
    // that the next time the idle alarm is set (after write/read activity
    // finishes), a compare-exchange to 0 happens, such that the idle alarm
    // can happen again.
    // All this has the net effect that from the moment of a successful lease
    // until the next call to `sendRequest`, we are sure that the idle alarm
    // does not go off.
    // Note that if one does not lease the connection, the idle alarm can
    // go off at any time and the next `sendRequest` might fail because of
    // this.
    // Furthermore, note that if one leases the connection and does not call
    // `sendRequest`, then the idle alarm does no longer go off and the
    // connection stays open indefinitely. This is misusage.
    // Finally, note that if the idle alarm goes off between a lease and
    // the following call to `sendRequest`, the connection might stay open
    // indefinitely, until activity on the connection has ceased again
    // and a new idle alarm is set. However, this will automatically happen
    // if that `sendRequest` and the corresponding request finishes.
