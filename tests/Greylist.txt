     - fix community cluster issues in test:  "testVertexDegrees" failed: ArangoError: Edge collection needs to be sharded by shardKeyAttribute parameter ('vertex'), or use SmartGraphs. The current shardKey is: '_key'
     - check whether the algorithms should double as examples then:
       - move the directory to common
       - add a way to aardvark to invoke it similar to the graph examples
     - split the testuite into one for each target
     - transparently make each testcase *one* test method that delivers a
       result
     - insulate tests that can share setup/teardown as setUpAll/TearDownAll
       into an own testsuite
     - fix remaining TODO statements in the testcases
     - check whether asan/coverage tests will make tests exceed the 15
       minutes threshhold, if - relax test by datasize for these
