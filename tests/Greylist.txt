# Greylist information

In this file we collect information about which tests are currently
greylisted. Please add a reason and date, and possibly links to issues
or PRs.

 - `./tests/js/server/resilience/moving-shards-with-arangosearch-view-cluster.js`
   as of now this test has frequent failures. The issue seems to be that
   the MoveShard operation from one leader to a different one does not
   reliably drop the old leader as a follower from the Plan in the end.
   See https://github.com/arangodb/release-3.4/issues/125

 - `./tests/js/client/resilience/foxxmaster-grey.js` there is a bug in the
   test code. Alan is looking into it.
