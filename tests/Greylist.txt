# Greylist information

 - `./tests/js/server/resilience/moving-shards-with-arangosearch-view-cluster.js`
   as of now this test has frequent failures. The issue seems to be that
   the MoveShard operation from one leader to a different one does not
   reliably drop the old leader as a follower from the Plan in the end.
