CommonJS Project History
========================

* January 2009: the group was formed as "ServerJS" following a blog post on Kevin Dangoor's Blue Sky on Mars
* March 2009: the dust had settled around "securable modules" as the module style for the group. This is CommonJS API 0.1
* April 2009: CommonJS modules were shown off with several implementations at the first JSConf in Washington, DC.
* August 2009: The group name was formally changed to CommonJS to reflect the broader applicability of the APIs.
