    /**
     * Regression test for PR https://github.com/arangodb/arangodb/pull/10190.
     * This bug was never in a released version.
     * In an AQL cluster query, when gathering unsorted data in combination with a LIMIT with non-zero offset,
     * if this offset exactly matches the number of documents in the first shards consumed, the rest of the documents
     * was not returned.
     * The test is undeterministic, but has a high chance to detect this problem.
     * This can only trigger when we skip a shard with the exact number of documents left in it,
     * AND the shard returning DONE with that skip.
     * Because of this, this problem didn't occur in 3.5, as the UnsortingGather dependencies were always RemoteNodes,
     * and the RemoteNodes always reported HASMORE when at least one document was skipped.
     * If we just used EnumerateCollection, the RocksDB iterator would also report HASMORE with the last document.
     * Thus we use a FILTER here, which overfetches - the test relies on this and will not work without it, but I see
     * no other way without writing a plan manually.
