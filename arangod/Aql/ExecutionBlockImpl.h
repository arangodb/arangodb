 * @brief This is the implementation class of AqlExecutionBlocks.
 *        It is responsible to create AqlItemRows for subsequent
 *        Blocks, also it will fetch new AqlItemRows from preceeding
 *        Blocks whenever it is necessary.
 *        For performance reasons this will all be done in batches
 *        of 1000 Rows each.
 *
 * @tparam Executor A class that needs to have the following signature:
 *         Executor {
 *           Executor(xxxFetcher&)
 *           std::pair<ExecutionState, std::unique_ptr<AqlItemRow>> produceRow();
 *         }
 *         The Executor is the implementation of one AQLNode.
 *         It is only allowed to produce one outputRow at a time, but can fetch
 *         as many rows from above as it likes. It can only follow the
 *         xxxFetcher interface to get AqlItemRows from Upstream.
