/**
 * @brief This is the implementation class of AqlExecutionBlocks.
 *        It is responsible to create AqlItemRows for subsequent
 *        Blocks, also it will fetch new AqlItemRows from preceeding
 *        Blocks whenever it is necessary.
 *        For performance reasons this will all be done in batches
 *        of 1000 Rows each.
 *
 * @tparam Executor A class that needs to have the following signature:
 *         Executor {
 *           using Fetcher = xxxFetcher;
 *           using Infos = xxxExecutorInfos;
 *           using Stats = xxxStats;
 *           static const struct {
 *             // Whether input rows stay in the same order.
 *             const bool preservesOrder;
 *
 *             // Whether input blocks can be reused as output blocks. This
 *             // can be true if:
 *             // - There will be exactly one output row per input row.
 *             // - produceRows() for row i will be called after fetchRow() of
 *             //   row i.
 *             // - The order of rows is preserved. i.e. preservesOrder
 *             // - The register planning must reserve the output register(s),
 *             //   if any, already in the input blocks.
 *             //   (This one is not really a property of the Executor, but it
 *             //   still must be true).
 *             // - It must use the SingleRowFetcher. This is not really a
 *             //   necessity, but it should always already be possible due to
 *             //   the properties above.
 *             const bool allowsBlockPassthrough;
 *
 *           } properties;
 *           Executor(Fetcher&, Infos&);
 *           std::pair<ExecutionState, Stats> produceRows(OutputAqlItemRow& output);
 *         }
 *         The Executor is the implementation of one AQLNode.
 *         It may produce zero, one, or multiple outputRows at a time. The
 *         OutputAqlItemRow imposes a restriction (e.g. atMost) on how many.
 *         Currently, this is just the size of the block (because this is always
 *         restricted by atMost anyway). Later this may be replaced by a
 *         separate limit. It can fetch as many rows from above as it likes.
 *         It can only follow the xxxFetcher interface to get AqlItemRows from
 *         Upstream.
