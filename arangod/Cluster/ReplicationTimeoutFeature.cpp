// We essentially stop using a meaningful timeout for this operation. 
// This is achieved by setting the default for the minimal timeout to 1h or 3600s.
// The reason behind this is the following: We have to live with RocksDB stalls
// and write stops, which can happen in overload situations. Then, no meaningful
// timeout helps and it is almost certainly better to keep trying to not have
// to drop the follower and make matters worse. In case of an actual failure
// (or indeed a restart), the follower is marked as failed and its reboot id is
// increased. As a consequence, the connection is aborted and we run into an
// error anyway. This is when a follower will be dropped.
