/**
 * From SLPA: Jierui Xie, Boleslaw K. Szymanski, Xiaoming Liu. Uncovering
 * Overlapping Communities in Social Networks via A Speaker-listener Interaction
 * Dynamic Process, 2011.
 *
 * The algorithm should actually be the following. In the paper, it is kept
 * much more general. Our intention of the implementation of the places
 * described generally in the paper is based on the ArangoDB's documentation.
 *
 * The algorithm is performed in a series of iterations during that vertices
 * send vertex IDs (natural numbers) to each other. Each vertex contains all
 * vertex IDs it has received and chosen since the beginning together with the
 * information how often an ID has been received and chosen. If na vertexId was
 * received and chosen, we say, it was saved. At the beginning, a vertex
 * contains only its own ID that was saved once. In an iteration, the vertices
 * are processed in a random order, which is chosen for each iteration
 * separately. A vertex v gets from each of its in-neighbors one of their saved
 * IDs. Which of the saved IDs is sent by an in-neighbor w is chosen randomly
 * with the probability
 *
 * <number of times the ID was saved by w> / <number of times any ID
 * was saved by w>.
 *
 * Vertex v chooses one of the received IDs to save in the
 * iteration and discards the others: it chooses the least ID out of those that
 * arrived most often. For example, if v received (3, 3, 2, 4, 4), it chooses 3.
 *
 * The number of iterations is an input parameter. Another input parameter is a
 * real number R from the interval (0,1]. Also let D be the number of all IDs
 * received by all vertices in all iterations (which is the number of all sent
 * IDs in total). After all iterations are done, each vertex returns all its
 * saved IDs filtered as follows. If an ID was received by the vertex X times
 * and X / D >= R, the ID is returned, otherwise not.
 *
 * Our implementation is quite different:
 *
 * (1) In an iteration, a vertex obtains messages not necessarily but with a
 * certain probability: (rnd() + this.ID) % 2 == gss % 2. This seems to be just
 * the probability of 1/2 but, in addition, whether the outcome is yes or no
 * correlates between different vertices. (Btw, the messages are sent anyway,
 * but if the outcome is no, they are not processed.)
 *
 * (2) A vertex always sends its own ID (why?!) and sometimes a saved ID that is
 * chosen as follows. Generate a random number r between 0 and the number of
 * times the vertex received any IDs (i.e., the sum over all IDs of the numbers
 * of times an ID was received). Now iterate (always in the same order) over the
 * saved IDs of the vertex and trace the sum of times they were saved. When
 * this accumulated sum reaches r (the randomly generated number), choose the
 * current ID and send it.
