v1.1.3 (2013-XX-XX)
-------------------

* added some more crash protection when reading corrupt collection datafiles

* added missing documentation for AQL CONTAINS() function

* fix case when an error message was looked up for an error code but no error
  message was found. In this case a NULL ptr was returned and not checked everywhere.
  The place this error popped up was when inserting into a non-unique hash index
  failed with a specific, invalid error code.

* fixed issue #381:  db._collection("_users").getIndexes();

* fixed issue #379: arango-password fatal issue javscript.startup-directory 

* fixed issue #372: Command-Line Options for the Authentication and Authorisation


v1.1.2 (2013-01-20)
-------------------

* upgraded to mruby 2013-01-20 583983385b81c21f82704b116eab52d606a609f4

* fixed issue #357: Some spelling and grammar errors

* fixed issue #355: fix quotes in pdf manual
 
* fixed issue #351: Strange arangosh error message for long running query 

* fixed randomly hanging connections in arangosh on MacOS

* added "any" query method: this returns a random document from a collection. It
  is also available via REST HTTP at /_api/simple/any.

* added deployment tool

* added getPeerVertex

* small fix for logging of long messages: the last character of log messages longer
  than 256 bytes was not logged.

* fixed truncation of human-readable log messages for web interface: the trailing \0
  byte was not appended for messages longer than 256 bytes

* fixed issue #341: ArangoDB crashes when stressed with Batch jobs
  Contrary to the issue title, this did not have anything to do with batch jobs but
  with too high memory usage. The memory usage of ArangoDB is now reduced for cases
   when there are lots of small collections with few documents each

* started with issue #317: Feature Request (from Google Groups): DATE handling

* backported issue #300: Extend arangoImp to Allow importing resultset-like 
  (list of documents) formatted files

* fixed issue #337: "WaitForSync" on new collection does not work on Win/X64

* fixed issue #336: Collections REST API docs

* fixed issue #335: mmap errors due to wrong memory address calculation 

* fixed issue #332: arangoimp --use-ids parameter seems to have no impact

* added option '--server.disable-authentication' for arangosh as well. No more passwd
  prompts if not needed

* fixed issue #330: session logging for arangosh

* fixed issue #329: Allow passing script file(s) as parameters for arangosh to run

* fixed issue #328: 1.1 compile warnings

* fixed issue #327: Javascript parse errors in front end


v1.1.1 (2012-12-18)
-------------------

* fixed issue #339: DELETE /_api/cursor/cursor-identifier return incollect errorNum

  The fix for this has led to a signature change of the function actions.resultNotFound().
  The meaning of parameter #3 for This function has changed from the error message string
  to the error code. The error message string is now parameter #4.
  Any client code that uses this function in custom actions must be adjusted.

* fixed issue #321: Problem upgrading arangodb 1.0.4 to 1.1.0 with Homebrew (OSX 10.8.2)

* fixed issue #230: add navigation and search for online documentation

* fixed issue #315: Strange result in PATH

* fixed issue #323: Wrong function returned in error message of AQL CHAR_LENGTH()

* fixed some log errors on startup / shutdown due to pid file handling and changing
  of directories


v1.1.0 (2012-12-05)
-------------------

* WARNING:
  arangod now performs a database version check at startup. It will look for a file
  named "VERSION" in its database directory. If the file is not present, arangod will
  perform an automatic upgrade of the database directory. This should be the normal
  case when upgrading from ArangoDB 1.0 to ArangoDB 1.1.

  If the VERSION file is present but is from an older version of ArangoDB, arangod 
  will refuse to start and ask the user to run a manual upgrade first. A manual upgrade
  can be performed by starting arangod with the option `--upgrade`. 

  This upgrade procedure shall ensure that users have full control over when they 
  perform any updates/upgrades of their data, and can plan backups accordingly. The
  procedure also guarantees that the server is not run without any required system
  collections or with in incompatible data state.

* added AQL function DOCUMENT() to retrieve a document by its _id value

* fixed issue #311: fixed segfault on unload 

* fixed issue #309: renamed stub "import" button from web interface

* fixed issue #307: added WaitForSync column in collections list in in web interface 

* fixed issue #306: naming in web interface 

* fixed issue #304: do not clear AQL query text input when switching tabs in
  web interface

* fixed issue #303: added documentation about usage of var keyword in web interface

* fixed issue #301: PATCH does not work in web interface

# fixed issue #269: fix make distclean & clean

* fixed issue #296: system collections not usable from AQL

* fixed issue #295: deadlock on shutdown

* added collection type label to web interface

* fixed issue #290: the web interface now disallows creating non-edges in edge collections
  when creating collections via the web interface, the collection type must also be
  specified (default is document collection)

* fixed issue #289: tab-completion does not insert any spaces

* fixed issue #282: fix escaping in web interface

* made AQL function NOT_NULL take any number of arguments. Will now return its
  first argument that is not null, or null if all arguments are null. This is downwards
  compatible.

* changed misleading AQL function name NOT_LIST() to FIRST_LIST() and slightly changed
  the behavior. The function will now return its first argument that is a list, or null 
  if none of the arguments are lists.
  This is mostly downwards-compatible. The only change to the previous implementation in
  1.1-beta will happen if two arguments were passed and the 1st and 2nd arguments were 
  both no lists. In previous 1.1, the 2nd argument was returned as is, but now null 
  will be returned.

* add AQL function FIRST_DOCUMENT(), with same behavior as FIRST_LIST(), but working
  with documents instead of lists.

* added UPGRADING help text

* fixed issue #284: fixed Javascript errors when adding edges/vertices without own
  attributes

* fixed issue #283: AQL LENGTH() now works on documents, too

* fixed issue #281: documentation for skip lists shows wrong example

* fixed AQL optimiser bug, related to OR-combined conditions that filtered on the
  same attribute but with different conditions

* fixed issue #277: allow usage of collection names when creating edges
  the fix of this issue also implies validation of collection names / ids passed to
  the REST edge create method. edges with invalid collection ids or names in the
  "from" or "to" values will be rejected and not saved


v1.1.beta2 (2012-11-13)
-----------------------

* fixed arangoirb compilation

* fixed doxygen


v1.1.beta1 (2012-10-24)
-----------------------

* fixed AQL optimiser bug

* WARNING:
  - the user has changed from "arango" to "arangodb", the start script has changed from
    "arangod" to "arangodb", the database directory has changed from "/var/arangodb" to
    "/var/lib/arangodb" to be compliant with various Linux policies

  - In 1.1, we have introduced types for collections: regular documents go into document
    collections, and edges go into edge collections. The prefixing (db.xxx vs. edges.xxx) 
    works slightly different in 1.1: edges.xxx can still be used to access collections, 
    however, it will not determine the type of existing collections anymore. To create an 
    edge collection 1.1, you can use db._createEdgeCollection() or edges._create(). 
    And there's of course also db._createDocumentCollection(). 
    db._create() is also still there and will create a document collection by default, 
    whereas edges._create() will create an edge collection.

  - the admin web interface that was previously available via the simple URL suffix / 
    is now available via a dedicated URL suffix only: /_admin/html
    The reason for this is that routing and URLs are now subject to changes by the end user,
    and only URLs parts prefixed with underscores (e.g. /_admin or /_api) are reserved
    for ArangoDB's internal usage.

* the server now handles requests with invalid Content-Length header values as follows:
  - if Content-Length is negative, the server will respond instantly with HTTP 411
    (length required)

  - if Content-Length is positive but shorter than the supplied body, the server will
    respond with HTTP 400 (bad request)

  - if Content-Length is positive but longer than the supplied body, the server will
    wait for the client to send the missing bytes. The server allows 90 seconds for this
    and will close the connection if the client does not send the remaining data

  - if Content-Length is bigger than the maximum allowed size (512 MB), the server will 
    fail with HTTP 413 (request entitiy too large).

  - if the length of the HTTP headers is greated than the maximum allowed size (1 MB),
    the server will fail with HTTP 431 (request header fields too large)

* issue #265: allow optional base64 encoding/decoding of action response data

* issue #252: create _modules collection using arango-upgrade (note: arango-upgrade was
  finally replaced by the `--upgrade` option for arangod)

* issue #251: allow passing arbitrary options to V8 engine using new command line option:
  --javascript.v8-options. Using this option, the Harmony features or other settings in
  v8 can be enabled if the end user requires them

* issue #248: allow AQL optimiser to pull out completely uncorrelated subqueries to the
  top level, resulting in less repeated evaluation of the subquery

* upgraded to Doxygen 1.8.0

* issue #247: added AQL function MERGE_RECURSIVE

* issue #246: added clear() function in arangosh

* issue #245: Documentation: Central place for naming rules/limits inside ArangoDB

* reduced size of hash index elements by 50 %, allowing more index elements to fit in 
  memory

* issue #235: GUI Shell throws Error:ReferenceError: db is not defined

* issue #229: methods marked as "under construction" 

* issue #228: remove unfinished APIs (/_admin/config/*) 

* having the OpenSSL library installed is now a prerequisite to compiling ArangoDB
  Also removed the --enable-ssl configure option because ssl is always required.

* added AQL functions TO_LIST, NOT_LIST

* issue #224: add optional Content-Id for batch requests

* issue #221: more documentation on AQL explain functionality. Also added
  ArangoStatement.explain() client method

* added db._createStatement() method on server as well (was previously available
  on the client only)

* issue #219: continue in case of "document not found" error in PATHS() function

* issue #213: make waitForSync overridable on specifc actions

* changed AQL optimiser to use indexes in more cases. Previously, indexes might
  not have been used when in a reference expression the inner collection was 
  specified last. Example: FOR u1 IN users FOR u2 IN users FILTER u1._id == u2._id
  Previously, this only checked whether an index could be used for u2._id (not
  possible). It was not checked whether an index on u1._id could be used (possible).
  Now, for expressions that have references/attribute names on both sides of the
  above as above, indexes are checked for both sides.
  
* issue #204: extend the CSV import by TSV and by user configurable 
  seperator character(s)

* issue #180: added support for batch operations

* added startup option --server.backlog-size
  this allows setting the value of the backlog for the listen() system call.
  the default value is 10, the maximum value is platform-dependent

* introduced new configure option "--enable-maintainer-mode" for
  ArangoDB maintainers. this option replaces the previous compile switches
  --with-boost-test, --enable-bison, --enable-flex and --enable-errors-dependency
  the individual configure options have been removed. --enable-maintainer-mode
  turns them all on.

* removed potentially unused configure option --enable-memfail

* fixed issue #197: HTML web interface calls /_admin/user-manager/session

* fixed issue #195: VERSION file in database directory

* fixed issue #193: REST API HEAD request returns a message body on 404

* fixed issue #188: intermittent issues with 1.0.0
  (server-side cursors not cleaned up in all cases, pthreads deadlock issue)

* issue #189: key store should use ISO datetime format bug 

* issue #187: run arango-upgrade on server start (note: arango-upgrade was finally
  replaced by the `--upgrade` option for arangod)n

* fixed issue #183: strange unittest error

* fixed issue #182: manual pages

* fixed issue #181: use getaddrinfo

* moved default database directory to "/var/lib/arangodb" in accordance with 
  http://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html

* fixed issue #179: strange text in import manual

* fixed issue #178: test for aragoimp is missing

* fixed issue #177: a misleading error message was returned if unknown variables
  were used in certain positions in an AQL query.

* fixed issue #176: explain how to use AQL from the arangosh

* issue #175: re-added hidden (and deprecated) option --server.http-port. This 
  option is only there to be downwards-compatible to Arango 1.0.

* fixed issue #174: missing Documentation for `within`

* fixed issue #170: add db.<coll_name>.all().toArray() to arangosh help screen

* fixed issue #169: missing argument in Simple Queries

* added program arango-upgrade. This program must be run after installing ArangoDB
  and after upgrading from a previous version of ArangoDB. The arango-upgrade script
  will ensure all system collections are created and present in the correct state.
  It will also perform any necessary data updates.
  Note: arango-upgrade was finally replaced by the `--upgrade` option for arangod.

* issue #153: edge collection should be a flag for a collection
  collections now have a type so that the distinction between document and edge 
  collections can now be done at runtime using a collection's type value.
  A collection's type can be queried in Javascript using the <collection>.type() method. 
  
  When new collections are created using db._create(), they will be document 
  collections by default. When edge._create() is called, an edge collection will be created.
  To explicitly create a collection of a specific/different type, use the methods 
  _createDocumentCollection() or _createEdgeCollection(), which are available for
  both the db and the edges object.
  The Javascript objects ArangoEdges and ArangoEdgesCollection have been removed
  completely.
  All internal and test code has been adjusted for this, and client code
  that uses edges.* should also still work because edges is still there and creates
  edge collections when _create() is called.
  
  INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Client code might still need to be changed in the following aspect:
  Previously, collections did not have a type so documents and edges could be inserted
  in the same collection. This is now disallowed. Edges can only be inserted into
  edge collections now. As there were no collection types in 1.0, ArangoDB will perform
  an automatic upgrade when migrating from 1.0 to 1.1.
  The automatic upgrade will check every collection and determine its type as follows:
  - if among the first 50 documents in the collection there are documents with
    attributes "_from" and "_to", the collection is typed as an edge collection
  - if among the first 50 documents in the collection there are no documents with
    attributes "_from" and "_to", the collection is made as a document collection

* issue #150: call V8 garbage collection on server periodically

* issue #110: added support for partial updates

  The REST API for documents now offers an HTTP PATCH method to partially update
  documents. Overwriting/replacing documents is still available via the HTTP PUT method
  as before. The Javascript API in the shell also offers a new update() method in extension to
  the previously existing replace() method.


v1.0.4 (2012-11-12)
-------------------

* issue #275: strange error message in arangosh 1.0.3 at startup


v1.0.3 (2012-11-08)
-------------------

* fixed AQL optimiser bug

* issue #273: fixed segfault in arangosh on HTTP 40x 

* issue #265: allow optional base64 encoding/decoding of action response data

* issue #252: _modules collection not created automatically


v1.0.2 (2012-10-22)
-------------------

* repository CentOS-X.Y moved to CentOS-X, same for Debian

* bugfix for rollback from edges

* bugfix for hash indexes

* bugfix for StringBuffer::erase_front

* added autoload for modules

* added AQL function TO_LIST


v1.0.1 (2012-09-30)
-------------------

* draft for issue #165: front-end application howto

* updated mruby to cf8fdea4a6598aa470e698e8cbc9b9b492319d

* fix for issue #190: install doesn't create log directory

* fix for issue #194: potential race condition between creating and dropping collections

* fix for issue #193: REST API HEAD request returns a message body on 404

* fix for issue #188: intermittent issues with 1.0.0 

* fix for issue #163: server cannot create collection because of abandoned files
  
* fix for issue #150: call V8 garbage collection on server periodically 


v1.0.0 (2012-08-17)
-------------------

* fix for issue #157: check for readline and ncurses headers, not only libraries


v1.0.beta4 (2012-08-15)
-----------------------

* fix for issue #152: fix memleak for barriers


v1.0.beta3 (2012-08-10)
-----------------------

* fix for issue #151: Memleak, collection data not removed

* fix for issue #149: Inconsistent port for admin interface

* fix for issue #163: server cannot create collection because of abandoned files

* fix for issue #157: check for readline and ncurses headers, not only libraries

* fix for issue #108: db.<collection>.truncate() inefficient

* fix for issue #109: added startup note about cached collection names and how to
  refresh them

* fix for issue #156: fixed memleaks in /_api/import

* fix for issue #59: added tests for /_api/import

* modified return value for calls to /_api/import: now, the attribute "empty" is 
  returned as well, stating the number of empty lines in the input. Also changed the
  return value of the error code attribute ("errorNum") from 1100 ("corrupted datafile")
  to 400 ("bad request") in case invalid/unexpected JSON data was sent to the server. 
  This error code is more appropriate as no datafile is broken but just input data is
  incorrect.

* fix for issue #152: Memleak for barriers

* fix for issue #151: Memleak, collection data not removed

* value of --database.maximal-journal-size parameter is now validated on startup. If
  value is smaller than the minimum value (currently 1048576), an error is thrown and
  the server will not start. Before this change, the global value of maximal journal 
  size was not validated at server start, but only on collection level

* increased sleep value in statistics creation loop from 10 to 500 microseconds. This
  reduces accuracy of statistics values somewhere after the decimal points but saves
  CPU time.

* avoid additional sync() calls when writing partial shape data (attribute name data) 
  to disk. sync() will still be called when the shape marker (will be written after
  the attributes) is written to disk 

* issue #147: added flag --database.force-sync-shapes to force synching of shape data
  to disk. The default value is true so it is the same behavior as in version 1.0.
  if set to false, shape data is synched to disk if waitForSync for the collection is
  set to true, otherwise, shape data is not synched.
  
* fix for issue #145: strange issue on Travis: added epsilon for numeric comparion in
  geo index

* fix for issue #136: adjusted message during indexing

* issue #131: added timeout for HTTP keep-alive connections. The default value is 300 
  seconds. There is a startup parameter server.keep-alive-timeout to configure the value. 
  Setting it to 0 will disable keep-alive entirely on the server.

* fix for issue #137: AQL optimizer should use indexes for ref accesses with 
  2 named attributes


v1.0.beta2 (2012-08-03)
-----------------------

* fix for issue #134: improvements for centos RPM

* fixed problem with disable-admin-interface in config file


v1.0.beta1 (2012-07-29)
-----------------------

* fixed issue #118: We need a collection "debugger"

* fixed issue #126: Access-Shaper must be cached

* INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: renamed parameters "connect-timeout" and "request-timeout" 
  for arangosh and arangoimp to "--server.connect-timeout" and "--server.request-timeout"

* INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: authorization is now required on the server side
  Clients sending requests without HTTP autorization will be rejected with HTTP 401
  To allow backwards compatibility, the server can be started with the option
  "--server.disable-authentication"

* added options "--server.username" and "--server.password" for arangosh and arangoimp
  These parameters must be used to specify the user and password to be used when
  connecting to the server. If no password is given on the command line, arangosh/
  arangoimp will interactively prompt for a password.
  If no user name is specified on the command line, the default user "root" will be
  used.

* added startup option "--server.ssl-cipher-list" to determine which ciphers to
  use in SSL context. also added SSL_OP_CIPHER_SERVER_PREFERENCE to SSL default 
  options so ciphers are tried in server and not in client order

* changed default SSL protocol to TLSv1 instead of SSLv2

* changed log-level of SSL-related messages

* added SSL connections if server is compiled with OpenSSL support. Use --help-ssl

* INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: removed startup option "--server.admin-port". 
  The new endpoints feature (see --server.endpoint) allows opening multiple endpoints 
  anyway, and the distinction between admin and "other" endpoints can be emulated 
  later using privileges

* INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: removed startup options "--port", "--server.port", and 
  "--server.http-port" for arangod. 
  These options have been replaced by the new "--server.endpoint" parameter
  
* INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: removed startup option "--server" for arangosh and arangoimp.
  These options have been replaced by the new "--server.endpoint" parameter

* Added "--server.endpoint" option to arangod, arangosh, and arangoimp.
  For arangod, this option allows specifying the bind endpoints for the server
  The server can be bound to one or multiple endpoints at once. For arangosh
  and arangoimp, the option specifies the server endpoint to connect to.
  The following endpoint syntax is currently supported:
  - tcp://host:port or http@tcp://host:port (HTTP over IPv4)
  - tcp://[host]:port or http@tcp://[host]:port (HTTP over IPv6)
  - ssl://host:port or http@tcp://host:port (HTTP over SSL-encrypted IPv4)
  - ssl://[host]:port or http@tcp://[host]:port (HTTP over SSL-encrypted IPv6)
  - unix:///path/to/socket or http@unix:///path/to/socket (HTTP over UNIX socket)

  If no port is specified, the default port of 8529 will be used.

* INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: removed startup options "--server.require-keep-alive" and 
  "--server.secure-require-keep-alive". 
  The server will now behave as follows which should be more conforming to the 
  HTTP standard:
  * if a client sends a "Connection: close" header, the server will close the
    connection
  * if a client sends a "Connection: keep-alive" header, the server will not
    close the connection
  * if a client does not send any "Connection" header, the server will assume
    "keep-alive" if the request was an HTTP/1.1 request, and "close" if the
    request was an HTTP/1.0 request

* (minimal) internal optimisations for HTTP request parsing and response header 
  handling

* fixed Unicode unescaping bugs for \f and surrogate pairs in BasicsC/strings.c

* changed implementation of TRI_BlockCrc32 algorithm to use 8 bytes at a time

* fixed issue #122: arangod doesn't start if <log.file> cannot be created

* fixed issue #121: wrong collection size reported

* fixed issue #98: Unable to change journalSize

* fixed issue #88: fds not closed

* fixed escaping of document data in HTML admin front end

* added HTTP basic authentication, this is always turned on

* added server startup option --server.disable-admin-interface to turn off the
  HTML admin interface

* honor server startup option --database.maximal-journal-size when creating new
  collections without specific journalsize setting. Previously, these
  collections were always created with journal file sizes of 32 MB and the
  --database.maximal-journal-size setting was ignored

* added server startup option --database.wait-for-sync to control the default
  behavior

* renamed "--unit-tests" to "--javascript.unit-tests"

* added option SKIP_RANGES=1 for make unittests

* fixed several range-related assertion failures in the AQL query optimiser

* fixed AQL query optimisations for some edge cases (e.g. nested subqueries with
  invalid constant filter expressions)


v1.0.alpha1 (2012-05-28)
------------------------

Alpha Release of ArangoDB 1.0
