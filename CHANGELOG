v1.1.beta1 (2012-XX-XX)
-----------------------

* WARNING:
  - the user has changed from "arango" to "arangodb", the start script has changed from
    "arangod" to "arangodb", the database directory has changed from "/var/arangodb" to
    "/var/lib/arangodb" to be compliant with various Linux policies

  - In 1.1, we have introduced types for collections: regular documents go into document
    collections, and edges go into edge collections. The prefixing (db.xxx vs. edges.xxx) 
    is gone in 1.1. edges.xxx can still be used to access collections, however, it will 
    not determine the collection type anymore. To create an edge collection 1.1, you can
    use db._createEdgeCollection(). And there's also db._createDocumentCollection(). 
    db._create() is also still there and will create a document collection.

* issue #235: GUI Shell throws Error:ReferenceError: db is not defined

* issue #229: methods marked as "under construction" 

* issue #228: remove unfinished APIs (/_admin/config/*) 

* having the OpenSSL library installed is now a prerequisite to compiling ArangoDB
  Also removed the --enable-ssl configure option because ssl is always required.

* added AQL functions TO_LIST, NOT_LIST

* issue #224: add optional Content-Id for batch requests

* issue #221: more documentation on AQL explain functionality. Also added
  ArangoStatement.explain() client method

* added db._createStatement() method on server as well (was previously available
  on the client only)

* issue #219: continue in case of "document not found" error in PATHS() function

* issue #213: make waitForSync overridable on specifc actions

* changed AQL optimiser to use indexes in more cases. Previously, indexes might
  not have been used when in a reference expression the inner collection was 
  specified last. Example: FOR u1 IN users FOR u2 IN users FILTER u1._id == u2._id
  Previously, this only checked whether an index could be used for u2._id (not
  possible). It was not checked whether an index on u1._id could be used (possible).
  Now, for expressions that have references/attribute names on both sides of the
  above as above, indexes are checked for both sides.
  
* issue #204: extend the CSV import by TSV and by user configurable 
  seperator character(s)

* issue #180: added support for batch operations

* added startup option --server.backlog-size
  this allows setting the value of the backlog for the listen() system call.
  the default value is 10, the maximum value is platform-dependent

* introduced new configure option "--enable-maintainer-mode" for
  ArangoDB maintainers. this option replaces the previous compile switches
  --with-boost-test, --enable-bison, --enable-flex and --enable-errors-dependency
  the individual configure options have been removed. --enable-maintainer-mode
  turns them all on.

* removed potentially unused configure option --enable-memfail

* fixed issue #197: HTML web interface calls /_admin/user-manager/session

* fixed issue #195: VERSION file in database directory

* fixed issue #193: REST API HEAD request returns a message body on 404

* fixed issue #188: intermittent issues with 1.0.0
  (server-side cursors not cleaned up in all cases, pthreads deadlock issue)

* issue #189: key store should use ISO datetime format bug 

* issue #187: run arango-upgrade on server start 

* fixed issue #183: strange unittest error

* fixed issue #182: manual pages

* fixed issue #181: use getaddrinfo

* moved default database directory to "/var/lib/arangodb" in accordance with 
  http://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html

* fixed issue #179: strange text in import manual

* fixed issue #178: test for aragoimp is missing

* fixed issue #177: a misleading error message was returned if unknown variables
  were used in certain positions in an AQL query.

* fixed issue #176: explain how to use AQL from the arangosh

* issue #175: re-added hidden (and deprecated) option --server.http-port. This 
  option is only there to be downwards-compatible to Arango 1.0.

* fixed issue #174: missing Documentation for `within`

* fixed issue #170: add db.<coll_name>.all().toArray() to arangosh help screen

* fixed issue #169: missing argument in Simple Queries

* added program arango-upgrade. This program must be run after installing ArangoDB
  and after upgrading from a previous version of ArangoDB. The arango-upgrade script
  will ensure all system collections are created and present in the correct state.
  It will also perform any necessary data updates.

* issue #153: edge collection should be a flag for a collection
  collections now have a type so that the distinction between document and edge 
  collections can now be done at runtime using a collection's type value.
  A collection's type can be queried in Javascript using the <collection>.type() method. 
  
  When new collections are created using db._create(), they will be document 
  collections by default. When edge._create() is called, an edge collection will be created.
  To explicitly create a collection of a specific/different type, use the methods 
  _createDocumentCollection() or _createEdgeCollection(), which are available for
  both the db and the edges object.
  The Javascript objects ArangoEdges and ArangoEdgesCollection have been removed
  completely.
  All internal and test code has been adjusted for this, and client code
  that uses edges.* should also still work because edges is still there and creates
  edge collections when _create() is called.
  
  INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Client code might still need to be changed in the following aspect:
  Previously, collections did not have a type so documents and edges could be inserted
  in the same collection. This is now disallowed. Edges can only be inserted into
  edge collections now. As there were no collection types in 1.0, the upgrade script
  arango-upgrade must be run when migrating to 1.1. This script will check every 
  collection and determine its type as follows:
  - if among the first 50 documents in the collection there are documents with
    attributes "_from" and "_to", the collection is typed as an edge collection
  - if among the first 50 documents in the collection there are no documents with
    attributes "_from" and "_to", the collection is made as a document collection

* issue #150: call V8 garbage collection on server periodically

* issue #110: added support for partial updates

  The REST API for documents now offers an HTTP PATCH method to partially update
  documents. Overwriting/replacing documents is still available via the HTTP PUT method
  as before. The Javascript API in the shell also offers a new update() method in extension to
  the previously existing replace() method.


v1.0.1 (2012-09-30)
-------------------

* added AQL function TO_LIST

* draft for issue #165: front-end application howto

* updated mruby to cf8fdea4a6598aa470e698e8cbc9b9b492319d

* fix for issue #190: install doesn't create log directory

* fix for issue #194: potential race condition between creating and dropping collections

* fix for issue #193: REST API HEAD request returns a message body on 404

* fix for issue #188: intermittent issues with 1.0.0 

* fix for issue #163: server cannot create collection because of abandoned files
  
* fix for issue #150: call V8 garbage collection on server periodically 


v1.0.0 (2012-08-17)
-------------------

* fix for issue #157: check for readline and ncurses headers, not only libraries


v1.0.beta4 (2012-08-15)
-----------------------

* fix for issue #152: fix memleak for barriers


v1.0.beta3 (2012-08-10)
-----------------------

* fix for issue #151: Memleak, collection data not removed

* fix for issue #149: Inconsistent port for admin interface

* fix for issue #163: server cannot create collection because of abandoned files

* fix for issue #157: check for readline and ncurses headers, not only libraries

* fix for issue #108: db.<collection>.truncate() inefficient

* fix for issue #109: added startup note about cached collection names and how to
  refresh them

* fix for issue #156: fixed memleaks in /_api/import

* fix for issue #59: added tests for /_api/import

* modified return value for calls to /_api/import: now, the attribute "empty" is 
  returned as well, stating the number of empty lines in the input. Also changed the
  return value of the error code attribute ("errorNum") from 1100 ("corrupted datafile")
  to 400 ("bad request") in case invalid/unexpected JSON data was sent to the server. 
  This error code is more appropriate as no datafile is broken but just input data is
  incorrect.

* fix for issue #152: Memleak for barriers

* fix for issue #151: Memleak, collection data not removed

* value of --database.maximal-journal-size parameter is now validated on startup. If
  value is smaller than the minimum value (currently 1048576), an error is thrown and
  the server will not start. Before this change, the global value of maximal journal 
  size was not validated at server start, but only on collection level

* increased sleep value in statistics creation loop from 10 to 500 microseconds. This
  reduces accuracy of statistics values somewhere after the decimal points but saves
  CPU time.

* avoid additional sync() calls when writing partial shape data (attribute name data) 
  to disk. sync() will still be called when the shape marker (will be written after
  the attributes) is written to disk 

* issue #147: added flag --database.force-sync-shapes to force synching of shape data
  to disk. The default value is true so it is the same behavior as in version 1.0.
  if set to false, shape data is synched to disk if waitForSync for the collection is
  set to true, otherwise, shape data is not synched.
  
* fix for issue #145: strange issue on Travis: added epsilon for numeric comparion in
  geo index

* fix for issue #136: adjusted message during indexing

* issue #131: added timeout for HTTP keep-alive connections. The default value is 300 
  seconds. There is a startup parameter server.keep-alive-timeout to configure the value. 
  Setting it to 0 will disable keep-alive entirely on the server.

* fix for issue #137: AQL optimizer should use indexes for ref accesses with 
  2 named attributes


v1.0.beta2 (2012-08-03)
-----------------------

* fix for issue #134: improvements for centos RPM

* fixed problem with disable-admin-interface in config file


v1.0.beta1 (2012-07-29)
-----------------------

* fixed issue #118: We need a collection "debugger"

* fixed issue #126: Access-Shaper must be cached

* INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: renamed parameters "connect-timeout" and "request-timeout" 
  for arangosh and arangoimp to "--server.connect-timeout" and "--server.request-timeout"

* INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: authorization is now required on the server side
  Clients sending requests without HTTP autorization will be rejected with HTTP 401
  To allow backwards compatibility, the server can be started with the option
  "--server.disable-authentication"

* added options "--server.username" and "--server.password" for arangosh and arangoimp
  These parameters must be used to specify the user and password to be used when
  connecting to the server. If no password is given on the command line, arangosh/
  arangoimp will interactively prompt for a password.
  If no user name is specified on the command line, the default user "root" will be
  used.

* added startup option "--server.ssl-cipher-list" to determine which ciphers to
  use in SSL context. also added SSL_OP_CIPHER_SERVER_PREFERENCE to SSL default 
  options so ciphers are tried in server and not in client order

* changed default SSL protocol to TLSv1 instead of SSLv2

* changed log-level of SSL-related messages

* added SSL connections if server is compiled with OpenSSL support. Use --help-ssl

* INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: removed startup option "--server.admin-port". 
  The new endpoints feature (see --server.endpoint) allows opening multiple endpoints 
  anyway, and the distinction between admin and "other" endpoints can be emulated 
  later using privileges

* INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: removed startup options "--port", "--server.port", and 
  "--server.http-port" for arangod. 
  These options have been replaced by the new "--server.endpoint" parameter
  
* INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: removed startup option "--server" for arangosh and arangoimp.
  These options have been replaced by the new "--server.endpoint" parameter

* Added "--server.endpoint" option to arangod, arangosh, and arangoimp.
  For arangod, this option allows specifying the bind endpoints for the server
  The server can be bound to one or multiple endpoints at once. For arangosh
  and arangoimp, the option specifies the server endpoint to connect to.
  The following endpoint syntax is currently supported:
  - tcp://host:port or http@tcp://host:port (HTTP over IPv4)
  - tcp://[host]:port or http@tcp://[host]:port (HTTP over IPv6)
  - ssl://host:port or http@tcp://host:port (HTTP over SSL-encrypted IPv4)
  - ssl://[host]:port or http@tcp://[host]:port (HTTP over SSL-encrypted IPv6)
  - unix://path/to/socket or http@unix:///path/to/socket (HTTP over UNIX socket)

  If no port is specified, the default port of 8529 will be used.

* INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: removed startup options "--server.require-keep-alive" and 
  "--server.secure-require-keep-alive". 
  The server will now behave as follows which should be more conforming to the 
  HTTP standard:
  * if a client sends a "Connection: close" header, the server will close the
    connection
  * if a client sends a "Connection: keep-alive" header, the server will not
    close the connection
  * if a client does not send any "Connection" header, the server will assume
    "keep-alive" if the request was an HTTP/1.1 request, and "close" if the
    request was an HTTP/1.0 request

* (minimal) internal optimisations for HTTP request parsing and response header 
  handling

* fixed Unicode unescaping bugs for \f and surrogate pairs in BasicsC/strings.c

* changed implementation of TRI_BlockCrc32 algorithm to use 8 bytes at a time

* fixed issue #122: arangod doesn't start if <log.file> cannot be created

* fixed issue #121: wrong collection size reported

* fixed issue #98: Unable to change journalSize

* fixed issue #88: fds not closed

* fixed escaping of document data in HTML admin front end

* added HTTP basic authentication, this is always turned on

* added server startup option --server.disable-admin-interface to turn off the
  HTML admin interface

* honor server startup option --database.maximal-journal-size when creating new
  collections without specific journalsize setting. Previously, these
  collections were always created with journal file sizes of 32 MB and the
  --database.maximal-journal-size setting was ignored

* added server startup option --database.wait-for-sync to control the default
  behavior

* renamed "--unit-tests" to "--javascript.unit-tests"
