not released yet
----------------

* fixed issue #193: REST API HEAD request returns a message body on 404

* fixed issue #188: intermittent issues with 1.0.0
  (server-side cursors not cleaned up in all cases, pthreads deadlock issue)

* issue #189: key store should use ISO datetime format bug 

* issue #187: run arango-upgrade on server start 

* fixed issue #183: strange unittest error

* fixed issue #182: manual pages

* fixed issue #181: use getaddrinfo

* moved default database directory to "/var/lib/arangodb" in accordance with 
  http://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html

* fixed issue #179: strange text in import manual

* fixed issue #178: test for aragoimp is missing

* fixed issue #177: a misleading error message was returned if unknown variables
  were used in certain positions in an AQL query.

* fixed issue #176: explain how to use AQL from the arangosh

* issue #175: re-added hidden (and deprecated) option --server.http-port. This 
  option is only there to be downwards-compatible to Arango 1.0.

* fixed issue #174: missing Documentation for `within`

* fixed issue #170: add db.<coll_name>.all().toArray() to arangosh help screen

* fixed issue #169: missing argument in Simple Queries

* added program arango-upgrade. This program must be run after installing ArangoDB
  and after upgrading from a previous version of ArangoDB. The arango-upgrade script
  will ensure all system collections are created and present in the correct state.
  It will also perform any necessary data updates.

* issue #153: edge collection should be a flag for a collection
  collections now have a type: the type can be queried in Javascript using the 
  <collection>.type() method. When new collections are created using 
  db._create(), they will be document collections by default. To explicitly
  create a document collection, use db._createDocumentCollection(). To
  create an edge collection, use db._createEdgeCollection(). The previous
  functionality to create edge collections via edges._create() has been removed.
  The distinction between document and edge collections is now done at runtime
  using a collection's type value, and not by addressing collections via two 
  different base objects (db.* and edges.*).
  The Javascript objects ArangoEdges and ArangoEdgesCollection have been removed
  completely.
  All internal and test code has been adjusted for this, however, client code
  that uses edges.* must be adjusted to use db.* instead.

* issue #150: call V8 garbage collection on server periodically

* issue #110: added support for partial updates

  The REST API for documents now offers an HTTP PATCH method to partially update
  documents. Overwriting/replacing documents is still available via the HTTP PUT method
  as before. The Javascript API in the shell also offers a new update() method in extension to
  the previously existing replace() method.

v1.0.1 (2012-XX-XX)
-------------------

* fix for issue #163: server cannot create collection because of abandoned files

v1.0.0 (2012-08-17)
-------------------

* fix for issue #157: check for readline and ncurses headers, not only libraries


v1.0.beta4 (2012-08-15)
-----------------------

* fix for issue #152: fix memleak for barriers


v1.0.beta3 (2012-08-10)
-----------------------

* fix for issue #151: Memleak, collection data not removed

* fix for issue #149: Inconsistent port for admin interface

* fix for issue #163: server cannot create collection because of abandoned files

* fix for issue #157: check for readline and ncurses headers, not only libraries

* fix for issue #108: db.<collection>.truncate() inefficient

* fix for issue #109: added startup note about cached collection names and how to
  refresh them

* fix for issue #156: fixed memleaks in /_api/import

* fix for issue #59: added tests for /_api/import

* modified return value for calls to /_api/import: now, the attribute "empty" is 
  returned as well, stating the number of empty lines in the input. Also changed the
  return value of the error code attribute ("errorNum") from 1100 ("corrupted datafile")
  to 400 ("bad request") in case invalid/unexpected JSON data was sent to the server. 
  This error code is more appropriate as no datafile is broken but just input data is
  incorrect.

* fix for issue #152: Memleak for barriers

* fix for issue #151: Memleak, collection data not removed

* value of --database.maximal-journal-size parameter is now validated on startup. If
  value is smaller than the minimum value (currently 1048576), an error is thrown and
  the server will not start. Before this change, the global value of maximal journal 
  size was not validated at server start, but only on collection level

* increased sleep value in statistics creation loop from 10 to 500 microseconds. This
  reduces accuracy of statistics values somewhere after the decimal points but saves
  CPU time.

* avoid additional sync() calls when writing partial shape data (attribute name data) 
  to disk. sync() will still be called when the shape marker (will be written after
  the attributes) is written to disk 

* issue #147: added flag --database.force-sync-shapes to force synching of shape data
  to disk. The default value is true so it is the same behavior as in version 1.0.
  if set to false, shape data is synched to disk if waitForSync for the collection is
  set to true, otherwise, shape data is not synched.
  
* fix for issue #145: strange issue on Travis: added epsilon for numeric comparion in
  geo index

* fix for issue #136: adjusted message during indexing

* issue #131: added timeout for HTTP keep-alive connections. The default value is 300 
  seconds. There is a startup parameter server.keep-alive-timeout to configure the value. 
  Setting it to 0 will disable keep-alive entirely on the server.

* fix for issue #137: AQL optimizer should use indexes for ref accesses with 
  2 named attributes


v1.0.beta2 (2012-08-03)
-----------------------

* fix for issue #134: improvements for centos RPM

* fixed problem with disable-admin-interface in config file


v1.0.beta1 (2012-07-29)
-----------------------

* fixed issue #118: We need a collection "debugger"

* fixed issue #126: Access-Shaper must be cached

* INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: renamed parameters "connect-timeout" and "request-timeout" 
  for arangosh and arangoimp to "--server.connect-timeout" and "--server.request-timeout"

* INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: authorization is now required on the server side
  Clients sending requests without HTTP autorization will be rejected with HTTP 401
  To allow backwards compatibility, the server can be started with the option
  "--server.disable-authentication"

* added options "--server.username" and "--server.password" for arangosh and arangoimp
  These parameters must be used to specify the user and password to be used when
  connecting to the server. If no password is given on the command line, arangosh/
  arangoimp will interactively prompt for a password.
  If no user name is specified on the command line, the default user "root" will be
  used.

* added startup option "--server.ssl-cipher-list" to determine which ciphers to
  use in SSL context. also added SSL_OP_CIPHER_SERVER_PREFERENCE to SSL default 
  options so ciphers are tried in server and not in client order

* changed default SSL protocol to TLSv1 instead of SSLv2

* changed log-level of SSL-related messages

* added SSL connections if server is compiled with OpenSSL support. Use --help-ssl

* INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: removed startup option "--server.admin-port". 
  The new endpoints feature (see --server.endpoint) allows opening multiple endpoints 
  anyway, and the distinction between admin and "other" endpoints can be emulated 
  later using privileges

* INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: removed startup options "--port", "--server.port", and 
  "--server.http-port" for arangod. 
  These options have been replaced by the new "--server.endpoint" parameter
  
* INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: removed startup option "--server" for arangosh and arangoimp.
  These options have been replaced by the new "--server.endpoint" parameter

* Added "--server.endpoint" option to arangod, arangosh, and arangoimp.
  For arangod, this option allows specifying the bind endpoints for the server
  The server can be bound to one or multiple endpoints at once. For arangosh
  and arangoimp, the option specifies the server endpoint to connect to.
  The following endpoint syntax is currently supported:
  - tcp://host:port or http@tcp://host:port (HTTP over IPv4)
  - tcp://[host]:port or http@tcp://[host]:port (HTTP over IPv6)
  - ssl://host:port or http@tcp://host:port (HTTP over SSL-encrypted IPv4)
  - ssl://[host]:port or http@tcp://[host]:port (HTTP over SSL-encrypted IPv6)
  - unix://path/to/socket or http@unix:///path/to/socket (HTTP over UNIX socket)

  If no port is specified, the default port of 8529 will be used.

* INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: removed startup options "--server.require-keep-alive" and 
  "--server.secure-require-keep-alive". 
  The server will now behave as follows which should be more conforming to the 
  HTTP standard:
  * if a client sends a "Connection: close" header, the server will close the
    connection
  * if a client sends a "Connection: keep-alive" header, the server will not
    close the connection
  * if a client does not send any "Connection" header, the server will assume
    "keep-alive" if the request was an HTTP/1.1 request, and "close" if the
    request was an HTTP/1.0 request

* (minimal) internal optimisations for HTTP request parsing and response header 
  handling

* fixed Unicode unescaping bugs for \f and surrogate pairs in BasicsC/strings.c

* changed implementation of TRI_BlockCrc32 algorithm to use 8 bytes at a time

* fixed issue #122: arangod doesn't start if <log.file> cannot be created

* fixed issue #121: wrong collection size reported

* fixed issue #98: Unable to change journalSize

* fixed issue #88: fds not closed

* fixed escaping of document data in HTML admin front end

* added HTTP basic authentication, this is always turned on

* added server startup option --server.disable-admin-interface to turn off the
  HTML admin interface

* honor server startup option --database.maximal-journal-size when creating new
  collections without specific journalsize setting. Previously, these
  collections were always created with journal file sizes of 32 MB and the
  --database.maximal-journal-size setting was ignored

* added server startup option --database.wait-for-sync to control the default
  behavior

* renamed "--unit-tests" to "--javascript.unit-tests"

* various bug-fixes

* support for import

* added option SKIP_RANGES=1 for make unittests

* fixed several range-related assertion failures in the AQL query optimiser

* fixed AQL query optimisations for some edge cases (e.g. nested subqueries with
  invalid constant filter expressions)
