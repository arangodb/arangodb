Dear ArangoDB users,

we are proud to announce our new manual for ArangoDB.

It is a complete overhaul, with huge changes and improvements, which became neccessary because the old manual grew so fast and was edited by so many people, that it became inconsistent.

We would appreciate if you could give us feedback.
Either by writing comments in the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/arangodb" target"_blank"> google groups</a> or by opening issues in the <a href="https://github.com/triAGENS/ArangoDB/issues" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.

You can find our new manual <a href="http://docs.arangodb.org" target="_blank">here</a>.

<pre>Changes highlights:
---------------------

* Everything in one place:  user manual, developers manual and adminstrators manual

* Completely new, consistent and themable design

* Improved navigation through sidebar

* Powerful search function

</pre>
