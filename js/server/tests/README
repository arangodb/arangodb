Conventions for testing framework:
==================================

All files in the directory "shell" and ends with ".js" automatically
take part in server shell tests (targets "shell_server" and
"shell-server-only").

All files in the directory "aql" and ends with ".js" automatically
take part in server aql tests (target "shell_server_aql"). Those,
whose filename contains the string "ranges-combined" are only taken if
the flag "skipRanges" in the test options is set to false.

If the filename contains the string "-cluster", then it is only
executed when testing in cluster mode. If the filename contains the
string "-noncluster", then it is only executed when testing in single
instance mode.

If the filename contains the string "-disabled", then it is not
executed at all. This is for tests that cannot be run from the
JavaScript test framework and have to be run from the Makefile.
