  CoffeeScript is a little language that compiles into JavaScript.
  IcedCoffeeScript is a superset of CoffeeScript that adds two new 
  keywords: await and defer.

  If you have the Node Package Manager installed:
  npm install -g iced-coffee-script
  (Leave off the -g if you don't wish to install globally.)

  Or, if you don't wish to use npm:
  sudo bin/cake install

  Execute a script:
  iced /path/to/script.coffee

  Compile a script:
  iced -c /path/to/script.coffee
