Some subdirectories in here are zipped and uncompressed on demand
on first access.
This is done to speed up the installation especially on Windows,
which has performance issues when unpacking a lot of small files and
directories.

In order to determine which subdirectories are worth to compress, 
run the following command
```bash
(for i in `find . -type d -maxdepth 1`; do echo -n "$i:"; tree "$i" | wc -l ; done) | sort -t ":" -k 2 -n | tac | head -n 11 | tail -n 10

./eslint:2422
./lodash:1056
./joi-to-json-schema:878
./timezone:684
./joi:388
./highlightjs:281
./mocha:278
./graphql-sync:109
./js-yaml:107
./sinon:106
```

To create the zip packages, one can then run a script as follows:
```bash
cd js/node/node_modules
for dir in eslint lodash joi-to-json-schema timezone joi highlightjs mocha js-yaml sinon graphql-sync; do 
  echo $dir; 
  (cd "$dir"; rm -f __package__.zip /tmp/package.zip; zip -r /tmp/package.zip .; cd ..; rm -rf "$dir"/*; mv /tmp/package.zip "$dir/__package__.zip"); 
done
```
