                    "notes": "Returns data from the server's replication log. This method can be called by replication clients after an initial synchronization of data. The method will return all \"recent\" log entries from the logger server, and the clients can replay and apply these entries locally so they get to the same data state as the logger server. <br><br> Clients can call this method repeatedly to incrementally fetch all changes from the logger server. In this case, they should provide the <em>from</em> value so they will only get returned the log events since their last fetch. <br><br> When the <em>from</em> URL parameter is not used, the logger server will return log entries starting at the beginning of its replication log. When the <em>from</em> parameter is used, the logger server will only return log entries which have higher tick values than the specified <em>from</em> value (note: the log entry with a tick value equal to <em>from</em> will be excluded). Use the <em>from</em> value when incrementally fetching log data. <br><br> The <em>to</em> URL parameter can be used to optionally restrict the upper bound of the result to a certain tick value. If used, the result will contain only log events with tick values up to (including) <em>to</em>. In incremental fetching, there is no need to use the <em>to</em> parameter. It only makes sense in special situations, when only parts of the change log are required. <br><br> The <em>chunkSize</em> URL parameter can be used to control the size of the result. It must be specified in bytes. The <em>chunkSize</em> value will only be honored approximately. Otherwise a too low <em>chunkSize</em> value could cause the server to not be able to put just one log entry into the result and return it. Therefore, the <em>chunkSize</em> value will only be consulted after a log entry has been written into the result. If the result size is then bigger than <em>chunkSize</em>, the server will respond with as many log entries as there are in the response already. If the result size is still smaller than <em>chunkSize</em>, the server will try to return more data if there's more data left to return. <br><br> If <em>chunkSize</em> is not specified, some server-side default value will be used. <br><br> The <em>Content-Type</em> of the result is <em>application/x-arango-dump</em>. This is an easy-to-process format, with all log events going onto separate lines in the response body. Each log event itself is a JSON hash, with at least the following attributes: <br><br>  <ul class=\"swagger-list\"><li><em>tick</em>: the log event tick value  <li><em>type</em>: the log event type  </ul> Individual log events will also have additional attributes, depending on the event type. A few common attributes which are used for multiple events types are: <br><br>  <ul class=\"swagger-list\"><li><em>cid</em>: id of the collection the event was for  <li><em>tid</em>: id of the transaction the event was contained in  <li><em>key</em>: document key  <li><em>rev</em>: document revision id  <li><em>data</em>: the original document data  </ul> A more detailed description of the individual replication event types and their data structures can be found in the manual. <br><br> The response will also contain the following HTTP headers: <br><br>  <ul class=\"swagger-list\"><li><em>x-arango-replication-active</em>: whether or not the logger is active. Clients can use this flag as an indication for their polling frequency. If the logger is not active and there are no more replication events available, it might be sensible for a client to abort, or to go to sleep for a long time and try again later to check whether the logger has been activated.  <li><em>x-arango-replication-lastincluded</em>: the tick value of the last included value in the result. In incremental log fetching, this value can be used as the <em>from</em> value for the following request. <em>Note</em> that if the result is empty, the value will be <em>0</em>. This value should not be used as <em>from</em> value by clients in the next request (otherwise the server would return the log events from the start of the log again).  <li><em>x-arango-replication-lasttick</em>: the last tick value the logger server has logged (not necessarily included in the result). By comparing the the last tick and last included tick values, clients have an approximate indication of how many events there are still left to fetch.  <li><em>x-arango-replication-checkmore</em>: whether or not there already exists more log data which the client could fetch immediately. If there is more log data available, the client could call <em>logger-follow</em> again with an adjusted <em>from</em> value to fetch remaining log entries until there are no more.

Primary indexes and edges indexes  are not included in this list.  </ul> The <em>state</em> attribute contains the current state of the replication logger. It contains the following sub-attributes: <br><br>  <ul class=\"swagger-list\"><li><em>running</em>: whether or not the replication logger is currently active  <li><em>lastLogTick</em>: the value of the last tick the replication logger has written  <li><em>time</em>: the current time on the server  </ul> Replication clients should note the <em>lastLogTick</em> value returned. They can then fetch collections' data using the dump method up to the value of lastLogTick, and query the continuous replication log for log events after this tick value. <br><br> To create a full copy of the collections on the logger server, a replication client can execute these steps: <br><br>  <ul class=\"swagger-list\"><li>call the <em>/inventory</em> API method.

The call to <em>/logger-follow</em> should use a <em>from</em> parameter with the value of the <em>lastLogTick</em> as reported by <em>/inventory</em>. The call to <em>/logger-follow</em> will return the <em>x-arango-replication-lastincluded</em> which will contain the last tick value included in the response.  <li>the client can then continuously call <em>/logger-follow</em> to incrementally fetch new replication events that occurred after the last transfer.  Calls should use a <em>from</em> parameter with the value of the <em>x-arango-replication-lastincluded</em> header of the previous response. If there are no more replication events, the response will be empty and clients can go to sleep for a while and try again later.  </ul> <em>Note</em>: on a coordinator, this request must have the URL parameter <em>DBserver</em> which must be an ID of a DBserver. The very same request is forwarded synchronously to that DBserver. It is an error if this attribute is not bound in the coordinator case. <br><br>",

Regularly, the last applied and last processed tick values should be   identical. For transactional operations, the replication applier will first   process incoming log events before applying them, so the processed tick   value might be higher than the applied tick value. This will be the case   until the applier encounters the <em>transaction commit</em> log event for the   transaction.  - <em>lastAvailableContinuousTick</em>: the last tick value the logger server can   provide.  - <em>time</em>: the time on the applier server.  - <em>totalRequests</em>: the total number of requests the applier has made to the   endpoint.  - <em>totalFailedConnects</em>: the total number of failed connection attempts the   applier has made.  - <em>totalEvents</em>: the total number of log events the applier has processed.  - <em>totalOperationsExcluded</em>: the total number of log events excluded because   of <em>restrictCollections</em>.  - <em>progress</em>: a JSON hash with details about the replication applier progress.   It contains the following sub-attributes if there is progress to report:    - <em>message</em>: a textual description of the progress    - <em>time</em>: the date and time the progress was logged    - <em>failedConnects</em>: the current number of failed connection attempts  - <em>lastError</em>: a JSON hash with details about the last error that happened on   the applier. It contains the following sub-attributes if there was an error:    - <em>errorNum</em>: a numerical error code    - <em>errorMessage</em>: a textual error description    - <em>time</em>: the date and time the error occurred    In case no error has occurred, <em>lastError</em> will be empty.  <li><em>server</em>: a JSON hash with the following sub-attributes:  - <em>version</em>: the applier server's version  - <em>serverId</em>: the applier server's id  <li><em>endpoint</em>: the endpoint the applier is connected to (if applier is active) or will connect to (if applier is currently inactive)  <li><em>database</em>: the name of the database the applier is connected to (if applier is active) or will connect to (if applier is currently inactive)",
