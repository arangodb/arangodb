    - `coffee-script` is upgraded to `~1.10.0` which could incur breaking changes
      when using the language with plugins and Gruntfiles.
    - `nopt` is upgraded to `~3.0.6` which has fixed many issues, including passing
      multiple arguments and dealing with numbers as options. Be aware previously
      `--foo bar` used to pass the value `'bar'` to the option `foo`. It will now
      set the option `foo` to `true` and run the task `bar`.
    -`glob` is upgraded to `~6.0.4` and `minimatch` is upgraded to `~3.0.0`. Results
      are now sorted by default with `grunt.file.expandMapping()`. Pass the
      `nosort: true` option if you don't want the results to be sorted.
    - `lodash` was upgraded to `~4.3.0`. Many changes have occurred. Some of which
      that directly effect Grunt are `grunt.util._.template()` returns a compile
      function and `grunt.util._.flatten` no longer flattens deeply.
      `grunt.util._` is deprecated and we highly encourage you to
      `npm install lodash` and `var _ = require('lodash')` to use `lodash`.
      Please see the lodash changelog for a full list of changes: https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/Changelog
    - `iconv-lite` is upgraded to `~0.4.13` and strips the BOM by default.
    - `js-yaml` is upgraded to `~3.5.2` and may affect `grunt.file.readYAML`.
      We encourage you to please `npm install js-yaml` and use
      `var YAML = require('js-yaml')` directly in case of future deprecations.
    - A file `mode` option can be passed into
      [grunt.file.write()](http://gruntjs.com/api/grunt.file#grunt.file.write).
    - `Done, without errors.` was changed to `Done.` to avoid failing by mistake
      on the word `errors`.
