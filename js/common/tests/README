Conventions for testing framework:
==================================

All files in the directory "shell" and ends with ".js" automatically
take part in client and server shell tests (targets "shell_client" and
"shell_server" and "shell_server_only").

If the filename contains the string "-cluster", then it is only
executed when testing in cluster mode. If the filename contains the
string "-noncluster", then it is only executed when testing in single
instance mode.

If the filename contains the string "-disabled", then it is not
executed at all. This is for tests that cannot be run from the
JavaScript test framework and have to be run from the Makefile.
