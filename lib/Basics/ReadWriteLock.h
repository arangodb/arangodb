/// @brief read-write lock, slow but just using CPP11
/// This class has two other advantages:
///  (1) it is possible that a thread tries to acquire a lock even if it
///      has it already. This is important when we are running a thread
///      pool that works on task groups and a task group needs to acquire
///      a lock across multiple (non-concurrent) tasks. This must work,
///      even if tasks from different groups that fight for a lock are
///      actually executed by the same thread! POSIX RW-locks do not have
///      this property.
///  (2) write locks have a preference over read locks: as long as a task
///      wants to get a write lock, no other task can get a (new) read lock.
///      This is necessary to avoid starvation of writers by many readers.
///      The current implementation can starve readers, though.
