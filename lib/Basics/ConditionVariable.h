/// @brief condition variable
///
/// A condition variable consists of a condition and a monitor.
///
/// There are only two operations that can be applied to a condition variable:
/// wait and signal. When a thread executes a wait call in the monitor on a
/// condition variable, it is immediately suspended and put into the waiting
/// queue of that condition variable. Thus, this thread is suspended and is
/// waiting for the event that is represented by the condition variable to
/// occur. As the calling thread is the only thread that is running in the
/// monitor, it "owns" the monitor lock. When it is put into the waiting queue
/// of a condition variable, the system will automatically take the monitor lock
/// back. As a result, the monitor becomes empty and another thread can enter.
///
/// Eventually, a thread will cause the event to occur. To indicate a particular
/// event occurs, a thread calls the signal method on the corresponding
/// condition variable. At this point, we have two cases to consider. First, if
/// there are threads waiting on the signaled condition variable, the monitor
/// will allow one of the waiting threads to resume its execution and give this
/// thread the monitor lock back. Second, if there is no waiting thread on the
/// signaled condition variable, this signal is lost as if it never occurs.
///
/// Therefore, wait and signal for a condition variable is very similar to the
/// notification technique of a semaphore: One thread waits on an event and
/// resumes its execution when another thread causes the event to
/// occur. However, there are major differences as will be discussed on a later
/// page.
