/**
   This list is owned by one thread: nodes can only be added on its owning
   thread. But other threads can read the list and mark nodes for deletion.

   Nodes have to manually be marked for deletion, otherwise nodes are not
   deleted and therefore also not this list because each node includes a
   shared_ptr to this list. Garbage collection can run either on the owning
   thread (via garbage_collect()) or on another thread (via
   garbage_collect_external()).

   A thread owned list contains an atomic list of nodes. If a node is marked
   for deletion, it stays in this list, but is additionally added to the atomic
   free list. The garbage collection goes through this free list, removes each
   node in this free list from the node list (and from the free list as
   well) and then destroys the node. Each node has a shared ptr to the
   thread owned list, which is removed when the node is marked for deletion.
   Additionally, the owning thread is supposed to have a shared_ptr to the
   thread owned list. Then a thread owned list is destroyed only if both the
   thread is deleted and all nodes are marked for deletion.
