// SuspensionCounter::await() returns an awaitable that suspends until
// notify() is called, and which in turn returns the number of notifies that
// happened while it was suspended.
//
// This is useful to connect a callee using WAITING for asynchronous execution
// with a caller that is a coroutine.
// The callee can be instructed to call notify() when it is done, and the caller
// can await the result of notify().
//
// Only one awaitable as returned by await() must exist at a time. In
// particular, concurrent awaits on the same SuspensionCounter are not
// supported.
//
// Note that calling `notify()` may result in a resume of the awaiting
// coroutine, thus executing arbitrary code. Therefore, as a rule, it should
// be posted separately on the Scheduler. This is currently naturally the case
// because it will be called by SharedQueryState::queueHandler().
// If a use case emerges where this isn't so, the SuspensionCounter could be
// made to post just the `_c.resume()` call on the scheduler, to avoid
// unnecessary overhead in the cases where resume isn't called.
//
// The implementation keeps track of its state in
// std::atomic<std::int64_t> _counter;
// . It's initialized to zero.
//
// - `_counter == 0` means no notifies have been counted since the last resume
//   (or since its creation, if it hasn't yet been resumed).
// - `_counter == -1` means that there exists an awaitable, returned by await(),
//   that has been suspended; i.e. it was `co_await`ed and _counter has been
//   zero when await_suspend() was called.
// - `_counter > 0` means there have been notifies while no awaitable was
//   suspended. The value of `_counter` equals the number of notifies.
