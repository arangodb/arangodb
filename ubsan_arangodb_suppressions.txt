# fix issues with RocksDB library
# (potentially no issues in RocksDB, but issues with UBSan
# failing to understand thread-local variables properly)
# there is also a pending issue in upstream RocksDB:
# https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/issues/10205
# we may get rid of our own suppressions once the upstream
# issue is fixed.
